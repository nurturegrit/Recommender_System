The year of newly minted Indian American GOP stars,"When President-elect Donald Trump retakes the White House in January, he could be flanked by a large cohort of young Indian American stars. There’s Kash Patel, who could become Trump’s FBI director if he’s confirmed, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who with Elon Musk will lead a new nongovernmental project called the Department of Government Efficiency. Alongside them, with quieter public receptions, Harmeet Dhillon and Jay Bhattacharya prepare for potential key roles in the Department of Justice and the National Institutes of Health, respectively. And there’s Vice President-elect JD Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, who will be the first South Asian American second lady. These Indian Americans are perhaps the most well-represented minority group on the president-elect’s newly announced team. With this ethnic group making up less than 2% of the population and typically among themost Democraticof all Asian subgroups, many find it surprising. Others say the Indian American community has been poised to fit into the current Republican mold for some time. As Trump cozies up to tech industry titans, continues to lambast China and cheers on India’s current government, it doesn’t appear to be an accident that Indian Americans are taking on key roles in his administration, experts said. “It’s remarkable how disproportionately represented Indian Americans are compared to other communities of color,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data. Their embrace of some of Trump’s positions — like Patel’s baselessaccusationsabout a secret “deep state” and Ramaswamy’s calls for massdeportations— are out of sync with the politics of most Indian Americans, experts said. But that might be changing. NBC News polling did not disaggregate for ethnicity, but according to national surveys of the Asian American electorate by AAPI Data, support for Democratic candidates has dipped. After the2016 election, 77% of Indian Americans said they voted for Hillary Clinton. In September 2024, 69% said they planned to vote for Harris. Asian Americans more broadlyshiftedright by 5 points, compared to 3.2 points for thegeneral population. “Trump had higher support among 18- to 34-year-old Indian Americans, and especially among Indian American men,” Ramakrishnan said. “It’s not just the native-born younger men like Ramaswamy and Kash Patel. It includes foreign-born younger men who are likely recently naturalized. You probably have a fair number of people working in tech.” Some find this mutual affinity contradictory to the story that brought them to the U.S. Trump campaigned on a heavily anti-immigrant platform, with allies like Ramaswamy promising to slash the H-1B visa program and even revoke birthright citizenship. In a statement to NBC News, the Trump team said Biden’s “incompetence” and undocumented immigration brought Indian Americans into the party. “Fed up with the last four years of economic stagnation, unlimited illegal immigration, and general incompetence under the Biden administration, Indian Americans came out in historic numbers to give President Donald J. Trump and his agenda to Make America Great Again a resounding mandate,” said Kush Desai, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson. Neither Ramaswamy nor Patel responded to requests for comment. “I think it fits really well with Trump’s vision of what he wants his right-wing, conservative, populist politics to look like,” said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University in New Jersey and the author of “Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans.” According to experts, a set of current national and international circumstances have helped create a runway for the GOP to embrace people like Patel and Ramaswamy when they otherwise might not have. At home, Indian Americans are thriving, they said. They’re on average the highest earners in the U.S. They’re overrepresented in the tech industry, and 77% of them have a bachelor’s degree or higher, according to AAPI Data. This didn’t just happen naturally. Much of it stems from the first major wave of Indian immigration to the U.S. in the 1960s and ’70s — mostly young people looking to enter white-collar fields. “It’s a very demographically specific group in terms of caste, class and access to education that they had in India that allowed them to come to the United States,” said Madhavi Murthy, an associate professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “The current cohort of prominent Indian Americans that we’re seeing now in political life are the children of this group.” Ramaswamy’s, Patel’s and even Usha Vance’s stories fit that mold. Ramaswamy’s father is an engineer and so is Vance’s — Patel’s father works in finance. Vance and Ramaswamy also both happen to be from upper-caste families — privileged in India’s stringent caste hierarchy, which, though illegal, still dictates much of social and economic life on the subcontinent. Ramaswamy describes learning about his high-caste Brahmin roots in his 2021 book “Woke Inc.” “Kings were below us,” he wrote, also mentioning how his family’s servants of a lower caste were required to enter the home through a different door and follow a different set of rules. “Caste privilege is part of who they are,” Mishra said. “Some of that does open up the possibilities of adopting a deeply, deeply conservative and hierarchical way of thinking about the world.” While Mishra says he doesn’t think Trump overtly considered race and caste when selecting his staff, he thinks those attributes could contribute to their personas as “model minorities” and their families’ immigrant success stories in the U.S. Also convenient for rising Indian Americans in the GOP is Trump’s icy relationship with China. “It’s a less crowded field in terms of talented people of color in the Republican Party,” Ramakrishnan said. “It’s more difficult for Chinese Americans to serve in prominent positions now than a decade ago or two decades ago because of increased tensions between the U.S. and China.” On the other hand, Trump’s perception of India and its Prime Minister Narendra Modi is strong. Some experts credit some of the Indian American, and in particular Hindu, success in the Trump administration to the president-elect’s affection for Modi and his government — a right-wing nationalist movement that some human rights groups blame for the rolling back of civil rights in India. Trump has put his close relationship with Modi on display on several occasions, joining hands with him at “Howdy, Modi!,” a rally in Houston that drew tens of thousands of Indian Americans in 2019. While none of Trump’s Indian American staff picks have spoken much about India’s government, both Patel and Ramaswamy have beenvocalin their support for Modi’sactionsin the past. Another Hindu Cabinet nominee, Tulsi Gabbard, has met with the controversial prime minister multiple times and championed him in the U.S. Gabbard, who is Samoan American and converted to Hinduism in childhood, could be Modi’s fiercest ally in the administration. In a video message welcoming Modi to the U.S. in 2019, Gabbard described India as one of the United States’ “most important partners.” She has also parroted Hindu nationalisttalking pointsabout “Hinduphobia”growing in the U.S.andprotectingHindus from jihadist Muslims, something that Trump, too, has capitalized on. “The Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,” Trumpsaidin a 2016 Diwali campaign message organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition. “We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.” In a statement to NBC News, Gabbard’s team said backlash against her for her connection with Modi is “bigoted.” “The repeated attacks that Lt Col. Tulsi Gabbard has sustained from the media and Democrats about her faith and loyalty to our country are not only false they are bigoted as well,” transition team spokesperson Alexa Henning said in an email. “Just like President Trump she also recognizes the importance of U.S. — India relations and working closely together to strengthen ties especially among common interests like combatting terrorism and strengthening economic ties.” While Trump isn’t necessarily assessing Indian American nominees based on their relationships with India, Mishra said, the partnership creates fertile ground for more Indian and Hindu politicians to come up in the GOP. “They may or may not be aligned to Hindu right-wing politics, but larger right-wing politics is what brings them together,” he said. Not everyone is on board with the Trump administration’s perceived inclusion of Indian Americans, no matter how much their policy visions align. “There is definitely an element of the right which is deeply racist and white supremacist,” Mishra said. Far-right and white nationalist Trump supporters have lashed out at the number of brown faces in Trump’s orbit, posting on platforms like X that they think this is a signal of softness on immigration. “JD Vance’s wife ‘Usha’ was not raised Christian and is not a Christian,” posted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist influencer whom Trump oncehostedfor dinner. “What kind of family is this?” “Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and names their kid Vivek is gonna support white identity?” Fuentessaidin another video. Similar far-right accounts echoed that sentiment, with one posting photos of Patel, Ramaswamy and Usha Vance’s family captioned “the future of ‘conservatism.’” In July, when Dhillon delivered a Sikh prayer at the Republican National Convention, she was the subject of similar trolling, with big right-wingaccountsaccusing her of “witchcraft” and calling for her deportation. Dhillon’s team declined to comment. Vance and Ramaswamy have both openly spoken about being Hindu, but it often comes with a caveat. Vance saidin a Fox News interviewwith her husband that despite her faith, she pushed him to get closer to Christianity. Ramaswamy has tried to hedge his Hindu faith by quoting Bible verses on the campaign trail and telling voters, “We share the same values, the same Judeo-Christian values in power.” Ramaswamy’s team did not respond to a request for comment but in August told NBC News that they disagreed with that characterization. “Yes, he knows the Bible better than many self-proclaimed Christians, but that’s exactly what allows him to speak with authority about shared values,” his senior adviser and communications director Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News. “He has given speeches where he invokes a fundamental teaching from Hindu scripture, the Vedas: ‘satyam vara, dharmam chara.’ It means: speak truth, do your duty. Which happens to be the heart of Vivek’s message to our country.” But experts said that to a right-wing base that loves Trump for his anti-immigrant stances and “America First” rhetoric, no amount of assimilative behavior will win everyone over. “I’m old enough to vividly remember post 9/11, many Muslims, many Hindus, many Sikhs from South Asian communities went into overdrive to prove that ‘we are truly Americans,’” said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. “We know today that does not work.” While speaking with Vivek Ramaswamy on his podcast earlier this year, conservative pundit Ann Coulter started by telling him, “I agreed with many, many things you said … when you were running for president. But I still would not have voted for you because you’re an Indian.” Sakshi Venkatraman is a reporter for NBC Asian America."
Elon Musk courts Europe's surging far right,"LONDON — Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are wrestling with a decision to fast-track legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in national elections afterfar-right leader Nigel Faragesuggested thatElon Muskcould donate to his once-fringe right-wing party, in the latest turn for the world’s richest man as he flexes his newfound political muscle. What began as a tech mogul railingagainst political correctnessin the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments onboth sides of the Atlanticto reckon with Musk’s growing political and cultural influence. Last week, Farage told the BBC that his Reform UK party was in “ongoing negotiations” with Musk after the pair met at Donald Trump’sMar-a-Lago estate. Musk, a South Africa-born U.S. citizen, is prohibited from making a personal donation to a British political party, but he could potentially contribute through the U.K. subsidiaries of his various companies, which reportedly made around £90 million in profits over the past two years. “He wants to help us. He’s not opposed to the idea of giving us money, provided we can do it legally through U.K. companies,” Farage said. The U.K.’s Electoral Commission has said Prime Minister Keir Starmer must strengthen rules around political donations to protect its elections from foreign interference,according to the U.K.’s Guardian newspaper. Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies. While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire’s words carry weight well beyond the tech world. Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called “woke mind virus” and championing anti-immigration rhetoric. His transformation aligns with the resurgence ofPresident-elect Donald Trumpand the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France’s National Rally,led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politicianGeert Wilders. His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire’s politics. Musk’s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a “tyrannical police state,” amplified calls for a general electionjust months after Starmer became prime minister,and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist. Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe,Musklast weekopenly endorsedGermany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country’s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. The AfD’s leader, Björn Höcke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefullyemploying Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings. Musk’s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany’s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholzlost a confidence vote. “Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attackat a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD. In September, Musk praised Italy’s far-rightPrime Minister Giorgia Meloniduring a black-tie event in New York, calling her a “precious genius” and “even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.” Meanwhile, behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Musk met directly with Xi at a 2023 dinner in San Francisco. His Tesla electric vehicles are largely manufactured in China, including at its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla’s largest factories. Asked about Musk’s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: “I’m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it’s Trump.” And in the U.S., Musk has already shown signs of his power over the political process, pushing the country’s government to the brink of a shutdown after joining with Trump toeffectively killa congressionalspending bill. While Musk’s outsize role showed what he can achieve in Washington, his capacity to wield political influence may begin to stretch beyond U.S. borders.

Lara Trump says she's removed her name from contention to be Florida's senator,"Lara Trump, President-electDonald Trump's daughter-in-law, said on Saturday that she decided to remove her name from consideration to be a senator in Florida. The announcementquashed speculationthat she was interested in replacing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump wants to serve as secretary of state. ""After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,"" Lara Trump said ina post to X. She went on to tease a ""big announcement"" that she would share in January. ""I remain incredibly passionate about public service and look forward to serving our country again sometime in the future,"" she added. ""In the meantime, I wish Governor DeSantis the best of luck with this appointment."" Earlier this month,she announcedthat she would step down as co-chair of the Republican National Convention. She previously ascended to the role in March. Trump, who ismarriedto the president-elect’s son Eric, reiterated in her post that she ""could not have been more honored to serve as RNC co-chair,"" adding that she was ""truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida."" If Rubio is confirmed by the Senate to serve as secretary of state, his seat will become vacant. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis haspreviously saidthat his team would likely make a selection for who fills Rubio's seat by the beginning of January. ""Florida deserves a Senator who will help President Trump deliver on his election mandate, be strong on immigration and border security, take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state, reverse the nation’s fiscal decline, be animated by conservative principles, and has a proven record of results,"" DeSantis said in a November post to X after Trump tapped Rubio. Even while at the RNC, Lara Trump had previously expressed openness to working in another position, fueling speculation that the Senate slot could become hers. ""If I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor. I have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me,"" she toldFox Newsin November. Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News."
Suspect in the German Christmas market attack faces charges of five counts of murder,"Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctoraccused of killing four women and a nine-year-old boy bydriving into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, now faces charges of five counts of murder, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault after appearing in court Saturday night. His court appearance comes as details emerge about the attack and his possible motivations. Germanprivacy laws prevent authorities from releasing the suspect's full name, though they confirmed that his first name was Taleb. Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News that al-Abdulmohsen was the suspect. The incident occurred on Friday when a black BMWplowed through the crowded market, leaving 200 people injured, about 40 of them in a critical condition. The victims are a 9-year-old boy and four women, aged 52, 45, 67 and 75. Al-Abdulmohsen bypassed security bollards—set up to prevent such attacks—with the rental vehicle and entered the crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg through a gap meant for emergency vehicles, Tom-Oliver Langhans, director of the Magdeburg police, said at a press conference Saturday. Once inside, al-Abdulmohsen drove 1,200 feet at speed into the narrow, crowded alley, knocking scores of people to the ground. Forensic scientists are probing whether he had intentionally disabled the car’s emergency braking system to maximize impact. Minutes after the attack, armed police confronted al-Abdulmohsen near the wrecked vehicle in a dramatic arrest witnessed by shocked bystanders. Magdeburg Police said investigations are ongoing and officers are appealing for witnesses to send in photos or video of the incident. At the press conference Saturday evening, officials revealed that al-Abdulmohsen had been questioned, without revealing what he had said. Nopens said the motive is still being investigated but that “the background of the act” could be linked to “dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany.” Officials said Friday that al-Abdulmohsen acted alone, which former New York State Homeland Security Advisor Michael Balboni characterized as the ""worst case scenario for security officials."" “This came out of nowhere,"" he told MSNBC's Alex Witt. ""You can monitor social media, but for the most part you’re not going to know the timing on this or what they’re going to do.” Al-Abdulmohsen had voiced anger at German police and at Germany, allegedly previously saying that, “The nation that is actively criminally chasing Islam critics to ruin their lives is the German nation.” He had first first entered Germany in 2006, sought asylum there in 2016, citing threats from Saudi Arabia, and worked at a clinic as a “specialist in psychiatry.” The clinic, in the city of Bernberg, 25 miles south of the attack, confirmed his employment to NBC News, saying that he had not been on duty since October, due to ""vacation and illness."" His online activity includes historic and recent inflammatory content on X, and he has been accused of erratic behavior by an NGO for refugees. He has aligned himself with far-right movements such as Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. When asked whether the attacker could have been stopped, Nopens said “We didn’t have the perpetrator in our focus.” Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London."
"Scams, trolls and impersonators: Bluesky faces dark clouds in battle to be the new Twitter","Government censorship, scam accounts, celebrity impersonation, propaganda and a user revolt over a journalist accused of demonizing trans people — these are just some of the hurdles faced by the nascent social media platform Bluesky. But they’re also signs of its rapid growth since the election. As Bluesky attracts more activity, particularly from thosefleeing Elon Musk’s X, it is facing the price of success: tough moderation decisions and a growing number of bad actors. Nearly 25 million people have signed up for the platform,according tometrics site ClearSky. While that number is still a fraction of X’s user base, Bluesky’s controversies and challenges are gaining mainstream attention — a sign of its increasing cultural relevance. Last week, the platform faced its most significant controversy yet: user backlash against journalist and media personality Jesse Singal joining the platform. Singal, who has reported on people who reversed their gender transitions among other topics pertaining to trans people, hosts a podcast that critiques perceived left-wing biases in media. LGBTQ nonprofitGLAADincluded Singal in its Accountability Project documenting “anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and discriminatory actions” by public figures. Singal’s presence on Bluesky, considered a hub for trans social media users, sparked apetitionsigned by over 25,000 people calling for his removal under the platform’s moderation policies. Singal is now the most blocked person on Bluesky. Bluesky didn’t address Singal explicitly in its response to the petition, butpostedthat it does not take down accounts based on activity off the platform. Bluesky didn’t respond to an NBC News question about the controversy around Singal, whohas reportedreceiving death threats he says the platform has not adequately addressed. Despite the uproar spilling onto other social media platforms like X and attracting attention from mainstreamfigures like Lizzo, most Bluesky users appear to be sticking with the platform. Beyond cultural flash points, Bluesky is also grappling with a range of brass-tacks moderation issues that come as the price of popularity. In one 24-hour period this November, the company announced it had received a record 42,000 moderation reports. “We appreciate your patience as we dial our moderation team up to max capacity and bring on new team members to support this load,”Bluesky said. After Brazil’s top court suspended access to X in August, Bluesky saw a surge in Brazilian users, including“stan” communitiesdevoted to particular artists. That led to an influx of copyright complaints, leaving Bluesky’s slim moderation team to sift through which posts to keep and remove, said Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky’s head of trust and safety, in an interview. “Brazilians love doing memes. They’re a fantastic user base. But our copyright requests went through the roof,” said Rodericks, who previously helped lead Twitter’s trust and safety team. Scammers have also followed the migration of social media users from X to Bluesky, Sean Gallagher, a principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos, told NBC News.  “Over the past few weeks, there has been a rapid increase in scam activity,” he said. Many are romance and “pig butchering” scammers who follow the same playbook they use on other social media sites: posing as romantic prospects in the hopes of establishing a fake relationship with a victim they can later exploit for money, Gallagher said. So far, Bluesky “has been aggressive in shutting down fraudulent accounts,” Gallagher said, and appears to respond well to people reporting suspicious accounts. Rodericks said even as Bluesky has experienced growing pains, they’re still not at the large scale seen on other major social media platforms. “There’s things that come with hundreds of millions of users, in terms of harms, that we’re not seeing yet.” But that hasn’t stopped some critics from zeroing in on the issues. Far-right X account Libs of TikTok, which is known for targeting trans people online, criticized Bluesky on Thursday, posting screenshots of articles written about the platform — one written by Singal about the death threats he said he received, and another about child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the platform. Bluesky has seen only a handful of instances of people posting CSAM, Rodericks said, when compared to the levels seen on other platforms, but the numbers are increasing. In 2023, while the site could only be accessed through invitation and before it had opened to the public, there was only one verified complaint to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the U.S. organization tasked with tracking online exploitation. This year, Rodericks said, there have been over 830 CSAM cases, each of which the company investigates manually. Most major social media platforms report much higher rates of CSAM. In 2023, X reported 273,416 instances of CSAM on its platforms, according to the center. Instagram reported 11,430,007. Posting CSAM prompts an immediate and full ban on the site, Rodericks said. The site also has its share of fake celebrity accounts, a problem that continues to plague larger platforms too. Last month, Bluesky began labeling fake celebrity accounts with “impersonation” if they didn’t label themselves as satire or fan accounts, ending the reign of a handful of accounts that registered famous people’s usernames soon after the platform launched. While it doesn’t appear that there is a vast ecosystem of celebrity impersonators aimed at scamming users, NBC News easily found a handful of unlabeled but clearly fake accounts for celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey and Cristiano Ronaldo. Representatives for those three didn’t respond to requests for comment. Bluesky’s approach to verifying that accounts are who they say they are — a problem that hasplagued Xin particular since Musk’s changes last year — is both unique and more technically difficult than other sites’. It treats every account as a website and lets anyone who owns a web domain register a Bluesky account with that URL. So instead of Bluesky verifying people’s identity individually, it lets anyone with an official website verify themselves and other users. “We are getting feedback that some people are finding it too technically challenging, because people are just used to usernames. So the question is whether through enough user education, etc., we can meet those needs through domain verification, or if we have to add other aspects in addition to that,” Rodericks said. Given Bluesky’s limited resources, Rodericks said, it doesn’t have immediate plans to label state-controlled news agencies from authoritarian governments, as Meta does and X did before Musk ended that practice. There are at least three Bluesky accounts that use the names of and only post stories from state-controlled news agencies — China Daily and People’s Daily from China, and RT from Russia — but none has more than a few hundred followers. None of the three news agencies responded to emails asking if those accounts were authentic. Disinformation researchers routinely identify account swarms, particularly pushing messages sympathetic to the Russian, Chinese and Iranian governments, on major social media platforms, although they rarely get significant traction. Often, those investigations start when the FBI alerts a social media platform to U.S. intelligence that it’s being exploited by an adversary to the U.S. To date, the FBI has not made that kind of outreach to Bluesky, Rodericks said. It also doesn’t have a dedicated internal team to hunt that kind of propaganda, but instead relies on user tips, automated sensors for inauthentic account behavior, and a volunteer moderator army managed through a nonprofit calledIndependent Federated Trust & Safetyto identify and take down activity that violates its terms of service. While there have not been clearly documented mass propaganda campaigns on Bluesky so far, researchers have seen some signs. “All social media platforms are used by adversaries,” Lisa Kaplan, the CEO of Alethea, a company that tracks coordinated online messaging and propaganda campaigns, told NBC News. “We’ve seen evidence of what is likely state actor activity on the platform. That said, it’s early and we’ve not yet seen a successful, coordinated effort.” “In general, we’re still very small fries, so people aren’t dedicating resources towards us from a nation-state kind of front,” Rodericks said. Bluesky has been blocked by at least two censorship-prone governments. According to the Great Firewall, a program that tracks internet censorship in China, the countrybegan blockingBluesky ahead of June 4, the anniversary of theTiananmen Squareprotests, a common spur for censorship in the country. Separately, Pakistanbriefly blockedBluesky in November, according to NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet blocking. Spokespeople for both countries’ consulates didn’t respond to requests for comment. Every social media platform has to walk the line between obeying the laws of every country it wants to operate in and deciding to resist potentially unfair government requests to block posts or turn over user information. But China and Pakistan didn’t prompt a debate, Rodericks said. “Neither government has done any type of outreach or communication to Bluesky,” he said. “From a principles perspective, we of course believe in a free and open internet, so we’re going to do our best to support the ability of citizens to access the community’s information. But as a small player in this space, we’ll do what we can to advance our objective balance against countries being able to control their own internet.” Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News."
Young adults are keeping themselves on their holiday gift lists,"’Tis the season for gifting, and young people aren’t leaving themselves out. Nearly half of Gen Z (47%) and millennial (43%) consumers plan to buy gifts for themselves this holiday season,according to researchersat the consulting firm Deloitte. That’s far ahead of the 27% of Gen-Xers and 15% of baby boomers who plan to do the same. A value-driven caution has settled intoholiday gift buyingthis year, and retailers aredangling deals and promotionsto attract increasingly frugal shoppers — including those thinking twice about treating themselves. But during the busy Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales weekend, Gen Z shoppers broke with other age cohorts to expand their self-gifting plans, from 65% last year to 69% this year, Deloitte found. Clothing and accessories, health and wellness, electronics, and experiences like travel and live events are some of the most popular categories for this type of holiday buying. At this age, I can just buy things for myself, so I’m going to. Lexi Zaragoza, 26, Santa Barbara, Calif. Lexi Zaragoza, a 26-year-old children’s social worker in Santa Barbara, California, said her biggest personal splurge this year was a gold locket from the jewelry brand Catbird. “At this age, I can just buy things for myself, so I’m going to,” she said. Zaragoza has been in her current role for two and a half years, her first full-time job after earning a master’s degree in 2022. She also teaches cycling fitness classes on the side and said she’s now making enough to comfortably shop for loved ones this season and treat herself, too. Like virtually every generation that came before them, Gen-Zers and millennials have been criticized ascoddledandself-absorbed, but some of their purchasing decisions that may look narcissistic to others could reflect basic economic realities, experts say. After adjusting for inflation, Gen Z and millennial workers — generally defined as those ages 12-27 and 28-43, respectively — havehigher median incomesthan previous generations did at the same age, and they’re also more likely to beoptimistic about the economy. The two generational cohorts have been expected to drive holiday sales growth this year, while Gen-Xers and baby boomers pull back. Gen-Zers’ holiday budgets are expected to increase 37% this season, more than double the 16% growth expected from millennials,according to forecastersat the accounting firm PwC. “Gen Z is a big bright spot,” says Lupine Skelly, a retail research leader at Deloitte. “They’ve got massive spending potential.” That’s partly because young adults typically don’t have as many big financial responsibilities like those that come with having families, owning property orcaring for aging loved ones. They’re waiting longer to have children and, given theforbidding housing market, less likely to have a mortgage than older generations. Gen Z is a big bright spot. They’ve got massive spending potential. Lupine Skelly, retail research leader, Deloitte And while the deep socioeconomic divides throughout the U.S. economy hold true for young adults too, many of those from middle- and upper-income households appear to have some extra clout as consumers. Indeed, Gen-Zers are much more likely to be authorized users of their parents’ credit cards than millennials were at the same age, aTransUnion report earlier this yearfound. In some cases, “maybe their parents are still paying for their insurance or their cellphones,” said Skelly. “There’s just a little more flexibility in their budgets.” Zaragoza said she sees some of these realities among her peers: “All my friends, none of us have kids. I think it’s hard for older generations to see us frivolously spending money like this, because at their age, they were focused on their family.” But Skelly said much Gen Z purchasing isn’t frivolous. Each year, the group moves further into adulthood and is faced with buying the necessities that come with first jobs and apartments — everything from couches to cars. “They don’t have the amount of stuff that the rest of us have,” she said. And the attractive discounts on offer this holiday season have made it a good time to spring for purchases that they need anyway and that would have been steeper during most other times of the year. Another factor that could be driving self-gifting is Gen Z’shigh engagement with social influencer marketing. “It’s not like an ad on television,” said Rodney Mason, head of marketing at LTK, the largest creator commerce platform. It’s much more personalized: “They’re not saying, ‘Hey, go buy these jeans.’” Instead, influencers deliver daily lifestyle content on platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram that mirrors an aspirational version of their audiences’ own lives. “They’re sort of like friends,” said Mason — friends who have “all the coolest stuff.” That has left many young social media users with highly individualized wish lists. Many who have held off for months on making a coveted purchase are finally seeing those items go on sale, and “they’re going to pull the trigger,” Mason said. Retailers have also been tailoring their holiday ads toward self-gifters, with brands like Oura Ring emphasizing self-care in recent years. The company said it saw a big jump in sales growth last year when it urged customers to “Give yourself the gift of health.” This year, its marketing chieftold Modern Retailahead of Black Friday, “We’re not being shy about it. The pace of all our lives keeps getting crazier, and leaning into self-care during the holiday season feels very natural.” Zaragoza said she’s thinking beyond short-term self-care to invest in items that will last her a lifetime. “Solid-gold jewelry, things for the home, things that I was going to buy anyway,” she said, “so I might as well get them at a better deal at this time.” Jing Feng is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy."
"Cost-sharing seemed like an alternative to health insurance, until the childbirth bills arrived","Health care sharing ministries advertise reimbursements for members’ medical bills. But they are largely unregulated, and most have restrictions on maternity coverage. ARDEN, N.C. — Rachel Kaplan was uninsured when she became pregnant last year. So her doctor suggested an alternative: a nonprofit called Sedera, which bills itself as a medical cost-sharing service. Sedera members pay monthly fees that get pooled together, and the organization can use the collected funds to reimburse members for medical bills. The model is somewhat akin to health insurance, but Sedera isn’t subject to the same regulations. “It seemed simple enough that we were like, ‘OK, this makes sense,’ only to find out when I tried to submit the bill from the hospital, we were denied,” Kaplan said. She and her husband, Andrew Sheffield, reached out to Sedera for reimbursement after their son, Lucas, was born in August 2023. The delivery had involved an induction, 40 hours of labor and ultimately a cesarean section — the kinds of complications that can send hospital bills skyrocketing. But to the couple’s shock, they said, Sedera told them they were ineligible, citing a policy near the end of the group’s member guidelines: Within the first year of membership, medical bills for childbirth “are not shareable.” “We basically gave Sedera our money and received nothing in return,” Kaplan said. “The rug was pulled out from underneath us.” Sedera did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Sedera is what’s known as a “health care sharing ministry,” one of more than 100 such groups in the U.S. Most are rooted in Christianity and emphasize their faith-based values. The model hasgrown in popularity and revenue in the last decade,as insurance premiums and claim denials have risen alongside soaring health care costs, fuelingdistrust of health insurance companies. The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a trade association representing seven large ministries, said that last year, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. were members of one of these groups. An analysis from the Colorado Division of Insurance put the total at around 1.5 million. That’s compared tofewer than 200,000 people before 2010. “They are looking for a faith-based alternative to the broken insurance model,” said Katy Talento, the alliance’s executive director. “They want freedom from being forced to go to certain doctors or facilities.” Among the key differences between ministry and health insurance plans are that the latter negotiate directly with medical providers, rather than reimbursing members. Most health insurance plans are also required by law to cover various services, including for pre-existing conditions, pregnancy and preventive care, whereas ministries can restrict coverage as they see fit and have no legal obligation to reimburse members. The ministries operate in broad view of state and federal regulators and got a boost from the Affordable Care Act, which stipulated that people without insurance could avoid fines if they belonged to one of these groups.President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Dave Weldon, is a former president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. One service ministries commonly restrict is maternity care, for which many require a waiting period before a member is eligible to be reimbursed, according toa Government Accountability Office report. An NBC News analysis found that at least eight of the 10 largest ministries have such restrictions. By contrast, under the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans are required to cover pregnancy and childbirth care as essential services, even if a member becomes pregnant before their coverage starts. NBC News spoke to four families who said they were denied or struggled to get reimbursed by their health care sharing ministry for pregnancy or childbirth-related expenses. All felt they had been deceived and warned other expecting families not to join, saying that the model can be just as bad — if not worse — than the system they opted out of. Two of the country’s largest health care sharing ministries said their restrictions on maternity coverage are designed to prevent people from joining solely to get reimbursed for pregnancy or childbirth costs then leaving soon after. “The members and leaders of most ministries have set some limitations on how early in someone’s membership that bills arising from pre-existing conditions or from pregnancy are shareable under their Guidelines. Where such limitations exist, they are designed to best steward the resources of the entire membership,” Talento said. Most health care sharing ministries follow a similar model: People pay a monthly membership fee, which varies by policy but can range from around $85 to $1,300. Members are responsible for an annual “unshareable amount” of their medical bills — somewhat akin to a deductible — before the ministry will chip in. Members inform their doctor or hospital that they’re “cash pay” patients (which can result indiscounted bills), then share copies of bills and proof of payment with their health care ministry. In addition to lower monthly costs than insurance premiums, the ministries advertise networks with shared religious values that exist outside the mainstream health care system. Some outline faith-based philosophies about caring for others when they fall ill. Beyond restricting maternity coverage, many groups’ policies state that they won’t reimburse for prescriptions, routine doctor’s visits, contraceptives or mental health or substance use services. Coverage for medical conditions that predate someone’s membership is often excluded, as well. And health care sharing ministries aren’t required by law to limit out-of-pocket costs or maintain large cash reserves to cover members’ bills the way insurance companies are. At least 30 states have laws that explicitly exempt health care sharing ministries from state insurance rules, too. “The health care sharing entity has full discretion to determine whether or not they are going to pay the claim, and sometimes it just comes down to whether or not they have the money to pay it,” said JoAnn Volk, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who studies these organizations. “That cannot happen with insurance.” The lack of regulation comes with some benefits, however: Ministry members have wide latitude to choose their doctors and can easily enroll at any time of the year. For those who get bills reimbursed in a timely manner, the experience can be largely positive. Still, some experts and state regulators say many health care sharing ministries promise more than they deliver ortake advantage of people seeking affordable coverage, in some casesgiving consumers the false impressionthat they are entitled to reimbursements or arepurchasing insurance plans. “The way they’re marketed and designed, many people buy them thinking they’re insurance and not realizing what the differences are,” Volk said. As nonprofits, many ministries file publicly accessible finance documents with the Internal Revenue Service. Volk and a colleagueanalyzed those formsfrom six ministries and found that their reported spending — usually a combination of reimbursements to members and internal operating expenses — often exceeded revenue. “This raises questions about the adequacy and stability of funding available to cover members’ health care costs,” the researchers wrote. Part of Sedera’s appeal to Kaplan was joining a supportive community — something she prioritizes in her everyday life. She and Sheffield live outside of Asheville, North Carolina, two doors down from Sheffield’s parents. Kaplan teaches yoga on Saturdays and is on a first-name basis with the cashier at her local grocery store. The couple owns a small painting company, but they determined that it would be too expensive to get a group insurance plan through the business or to purchase an individual plan. Sedera’s $147 monthly fee seemed like the best option. “I thought I had done all my homework,” Sheffield said. Now, the couple blames themselves for not noticing the maternity policy — located on Page 44 of Sedera’s 49-page guidelines, which are available for download on its website. Kaplan said she tried for months to get Sedera to reimburse her delivery costs, which the hospital discounted to around $7,000, without success. “It was so stressful. I was crying my eyes out. I was bawling. I was pleading with Sedera. I was calling Sedera every day,” Kaplan said. “They had no mercy for us. No grace at all.” The couple has since paid the delivery bill, along with around $2,800 for Kaplan’s anesthesia, but still owe around $2,500 for a physician’s fee. Enrollment in health care sharing ministries is not reported or tracked federally, and Colorado is the only state that requires ministries operating there to report such data. The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries sued in May to challenge that requirement,alleging it violates their religious liberty. To attract new members, some health care sharing ministries pay insurance brokers a higher commission than insurance companies do, according toa report from the Urban Institute, an economic think tank. Other people learn about the groups through church communities. That was the case for the Pelons, a family of six in Longmont, Colorado, who in 2020 became off-and-on members of Christian Healthcare Ministries — the country’s oldest and largest ministry, founded in 1981. Dana Pelon said she had a similar experience to Kaplan’s: She had recently rejoined when she found out she was pregnant unexpectedly, but Christian Healthcare Ministries only offers maternity cost-sharing for members who join at least 300 days before their due dates. Pelon was just shy of that cutoff so was told she wasn’t eligible. “There was no compassion,” she said. “It was just like, ‘Nope, we’ll cover any due date after this day.’ And it was 27 days after my daughter’s due date.’” Christian Healthcare Ministries said its maternity policy “eliminates the possibility that someone might try to ‘game’ the system by joining shortly before giving birth, having CHM members share funds to pay their medical expenses, and then leave the ministry shortly after the birth,” said Lauren Gajdek, the group’s vice president of communications. Another of the country’s largest health care sharing ministries, Liberty HealthShare, has been a target of member complaints and a lawsuit in recent years. Warren Walborn said he learned about Liberty from friends when he and his wife, Liezel Ann, were “looking for alternatives to not get killed on the premiums as insurance costs were going through the roof.” Theaverage family premium for employer-sponsored health insurancehas increased 24% since 2019, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. Walborn said he was never reimbursed for his wife’s prenatal care or the delivery of their daughter Sophie in 2021. Walborn said he submitted invoices within 180 days of medical service dates, per Liberty’s policy, but the company then requested itemized charges and additional documentation. That back-and-forth continued, he said, until the 180-day mark passed, after which point Liberty told him he was no longer eligible for reimbursement because of the time limit. “I kept fastidious records of all of these codes and everything. It was never good enough for them,” he said. “It was like … if I had hair, I would pull it all out.” “I said to myself, ‘You know, why am I sending them money every month?’” Walborn added. “‘They’re not going to ever send me anything.’” Kallie Seiter, a mother of five from Ogden, Utah, was also a member of Liberty during her pregnancy in 2019. She sent Liberty an estimate for the delivery cost at her chosen birth center ahead of time — around $5,000 — and a representative assured her in writing that it would be covered in full, according to emails reviewed by NBC News. But that was incorrect, as Seiter’s annual “unshareable amount” reset two months before her baby was born. Liberty later declined to reimburse the full sum for that reason. After a year-and-a-half dispute, Seiter succeeded in recouping her $5,000. But she left Liberty for good. “If someone were to ask me if I recommend Liberty for pregnancy, I would definitely tell them to stay far away from it,” she said. In response to an inquiry about Seiter’s and Walborn’s cases, Liberty said it is transparent about its guidelines, which members agree to when they sign up. “We regret that the processing of these members’ bills was delayed, but in an organization that receives hundreds of thousands of bills annually, processing errors may occur despite our best efforts,” said Timothy Bryan, the group’s vice president of marketing and communications. “We note these situations occurred over five years ago and Liberty has significantly improved its processes over this time period,” he added. Liberty agreed to a settlement with the Ohio attorney general in 2021 that required it to replace its top leadership, but it did not admit wrongdoing. A group of former Liberty members also sued the ministry that year, alleging that the organization had refused to pay covered medical procedures while reaping “massive profits.” Liberty said in court filings that the Ohio settlement has remedied those plaintiffs’ claims. The suit is ongoing. Weldon, Trump’s pick to lead the CDC, haspraised health care sharing ministriesfor giving consumers more options and flexibility. But he told NBC News that while president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, he worried that bad actors could cast a negative light on the model. “I tried to promote getting all of those ministries together to develop rigorous self-policing standards,” he said, adding: “They all sort of marched to their own drummer, and I repeatedly reminded them that if they didn’t really clean their act up, that they were going to be regulated by 50 different [state] governments.” Indeed, some state officials and other groups have tried to limit the ministries’ reach. The American Hospital Association sent a warning about the ministries to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year.More than a dozen state insurance departments haveissued consumer alertsabout the ministries. And over the last five years, some state regulators and attorneys general have taken a range of legal actions against a few health care sharing ministries, accusing them of misrepresenting their plans. On the federal level, Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., reintroduced a bill last year that would require health care sharing ministries to submit annual financial disclosures to the IRS and other regulators, but the bill hasstalledin committee. Trump’s last presidential administration was somewhat friendly to health care sharing ministries. Talento worked for the White House during that term, and as president, Trumpissued an executive ordercalling on the treasury secretary to consider making payments to health care sharing ministries tax deductible. The Treasury Department proposed such a change, but it was never finalized. Volk said the effort could be revived under the new administration. She also worries that more people might enroll in ministries after a tax credit for certain insurance premiums expires as expected next year. Families who have left the ministries hope their stories will dissuade others from joining. Kaplan and Sheffield said the bills they had to pay without reimbursement from Sedera have made them question whether to have a second child. The couple remains uninsured. “We want to have another one, but not the way we did it, not how it happened,” Kaplan said. “Shouldn’t we want to have a family?” she added. “The system makes it so difficult.” This article was produced in collaboration with the USC AnnenbergCenter for Health Journalism’s 2024 National Fellowship Fund for Reporting on Child Well-being.

"Rickey Henderson, Major League Baseball's all-time base stealer, dies at 65","Rickey Henderson, the greatest base stealer in Major League Baseball history and one of the game’s most enduring players, has died, Major League Baseball confirmed Saturday. He was 65. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred called Henderson the “gold standard of base stealing and leadoff hitting” in a statement Saturday that expressed the league’s condolences. “Rickey epitomized speed, power and entertainment in setting the tone at the top of the lineup.” The Athletics, who next season will play in Sacramento after moving from Oakland, said Henderson was “undoubtedly the most legendary player in Oakland history.” A star high school athlete in Oakland, California, Henderson was drafted in 1976 by the A’s and made his MLB debut three years later, at just 20 years old. After 10 All-Star appearances, World Series championships with Oakland and Toronto, and a career nearly beyond compare, his final MLB game came in 2003, at age 44. “Rickey lived his life with integrity, and his love for baseball was paramount,” his daughters and wife, Pamela Henderson, said in astatement posted to Xby the Athletics. “Now, Rickey is at peace with the Lord, cherishing the extraordinary moments and achievements he leaves behind.” Nicknamed the “Man of Steal” and known for often referring to himself in the third person, Henderson ranks first all time in both stolen bases, with 1,406, and runs scored, with 2,295. His gift of speed and anticipation on the base paths was immediately apparent when, in his first full season in 1980, Henderson stole 100 bases to break Lou Brock’s MLB single-season record. In 1982, he stole 130 bases, which remains the single-season record of the modern era. “Rickey set a standard for power, speed and dynamic play that can never be duplicated,” Tony Clark, the executive director of the MLB Players Association, said in a statement. “He revolutionized expectations at the top of the order.” Eleven years later, after he broke Brock’s career record, Henderson stood on the field in Oakland and left no doubt about his place. “Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing,” Henderson said, holding a microphone. “But today, I am the greatest of all time.” But Henderson was a feared leadoff hitter not only because of his speed, but also because of his patience at the plate to get on base. In 2001 while playing for San Diego — one of the nine teams he played for over a 25-year career — Henderson passed Babe Ruth as MLB’s all-time walks leader. He now sits second, behind Barry Bonds, but Henderson remains the leader in unintentional walks drawn, with 2,129. After leading MLB in runs, stolen bases and on-base percentage in 1990, and tying his career high with 28 home runs, Henderson was named the most valuable player of the American League. Upon winning the honor, Henderson toldreportersat the time that, in his opinion, he had played better in at least three other seasons. Henderson was best-known for his four stints playing with the Athletics, something of a hometown team for Henderson, who was born in Chicago but spent high school in Oakland. A field near his high school, Oakland Tech, still bears Henderson’s name. The Athletics won the 1989 World Series with Henderson hitting .441 during the postseason, including nine walks. Henderson is one of just 33 players with 3,000 hits. In 2002, one year after he joined that exclusive club, Henderson tried to work his way back to the majors through the minor leagues, first on a minor-league deal with Boston. In 3,081 career games, Henderson racked up 13,346 plate appearances, marks that only Pete Rose, Carl Yastrzemski and Henry Aaron have exceeded in MLB history. “There was only one Rickey Henderson in baseball,” George Steinbrenner, the former Yankees owner, once said, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame. “He was the greatest leadoff hitter of all time.” In 2003, with MLB interest slim, he played for the independent-league Newark Bears. He eventually latched on with the Dodgers, his final MLB team. Dave Winfield, a former teammate of Henderson’s, posted news of Henderson’s death on Instagram. “I still cannot believe I’ve lost one of my favorite teammates and great friend Rickey Henderson. Rest in peace,” Winfield posted. Andrew Greif is a freelance sports journalist."
Blake Lively accuses 'It Ends With Us' co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and retaliation,"Blake Lively accused her co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment on the set of “It Ends With Us,” and then trying to ruin her reputation after she expressed her concerns, according to a complaint she filed. The undated complaint, filed with the California Civil Rights Department, says that things got so bad on set that an “all hands” meeting was called on Jan. 4 to address issues “that had nearly derailed production of the film.” Lively, Baldoni, executives for Sony Pictures Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios, as well as Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting. According to the complaint, obtained by NBC News on Saturday, numerous issues were raised during the meeting, ranging from inappropriate conversations to alleged “retaliatory or abusive behavior.” The complaint, a precursor to a lawsuit, was first reported by TMZ. Bryan Freedman, who is representing Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, called the allegations “categorically false.” “These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,” he said in a statement. Freedman said Lively's complaint was “another desperate attempt to ‘fix’ her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.” Lively’s complaint accuses Baldoni, who is also the film’s director, of showing “nude videos or images of women” to her and improvising physical intimacy that had not been previously rehearsed or discussed. During one alleged incident, Baldoni improvised numerous kisses during a scene, the complaint says. “Mr. Baldoni insisted on shooting the full scene over and over again, well beyond what would have been required on an ordinary set, and without advance notice or consent,” it states. Another incident alleges that Baldoni did not act in character while they filmed a slow dance scene that did not require sound. “At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, ‘it smells so good.’ None of this was remotely in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound,” the complaint says, adding: “Mr. Baldoni was caressing Ms. Lively with his mouth in a way that had nothing to do with their roles. When Ms. Lively later objected to this behavior, Mr. Baldoni’s response was, ‘I’m not even attracted to you.’” The complaint further alleges that Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the chief executive officer of Wayfarer, pressured her “to simulate full nudity” during a scene in which she was giving birth. The complaint says that nudity was not mentioned in the script and was not discussed previously with Lively. When it was filmed, Baldoni and Heath failed to close the set, “allowing non-essential crew to pass through while Ms. Lively was mostly nude,” it says. The complaint also accuses Baldoni of having his “best friend” play the role of Lively’s doctor, when typically the part would go to a local actor. The complaint describes several other incidents including Baldoni allegedly telling Lively he could speak to her dead father, trying to enter her trailer while she was nude, and implying to Lively’s fitness trainer that he wanted her to lose weight. Lively filmed the movie shortly after giving birth to her fourth child, the complaint says. Baldoni and Heath are also accused of discussing their personal sexual experiences and alleged “pornography addiction.” Sony Pictures Entertainment could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. Sony, the film’s distributor, is not named as a defendant. According to the complaint, Baldoni hired a crisis communications team to launch a “retaliatory social manipulation campaign” against Lively during the film’s promotion to destroy her reputation. Thefilm made headlines over the summerafter fans, suspecting behind-the-scenes drama, began picking apart red carpet interactions and interviews with the cast. Many fans zeroed in on the fact that Baldoni was doing press separately from his co-stars and that some of the film’s stars, including Lively and Jenny Slate, did not follow him on Instagram. The movie, based on Colleen Hoover’s bestselling novel, follows Lively’s character, Lily Bloom, and her abusive relationship with a neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. Slate plays Allysa Kincaid, Ryle’s sister. Lively’s complaint alleges that amarketing plan for the film stated the cast would focus on a “story of hope”instead of domestic violence, but Baldoni “abruptly pivoted away from the film’s marketing plan” in an effort to explain why cast and crew had unfollowed him on social media and to destroy Lively’s reputation because she spoke up on set about his alleged misconduct. Freedman, Baldoni’s attorney, said Wayfarer hired a crisis communications team because Lively allegedly threatened not to show up to set during filming and threatened not to promote the film. “The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity,” he said. Lively said she hopes her “legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.” Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
2 U.S. Navy pilots eject to safety after friendly fire downs their fighter jet,"Two U.S. Navy pilots safely ejected over the Red Sea on Sunday after the F/A-18 fighter jet they were in was shot down by what appeared to be friendly fire, U.S. Central Command said. The F/A-18 was flying off of the USS Harry S. Truman when it was downed, CENTCOM said in a statement. One of the pilots may have sustained minor injuries during the ejection, CENTCOM said. The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the region, “mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,” it said. “A full investigation is underway,” CENTCOM added. Officials didn’t release the fighter’s exact mission. The apparent accident happened Sunday morning in the region between Africa and the Middle East, a focus of U.S. military assets assembled to protect U.S. personnel, coalition partners and global shipping interests. On Dec. 15, CENTCOM said in a statement that the strike group had entered its area of command, which includes the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia. The strike group also includes Carrier Air Wing 1, Destroyer Squadron 28, and two Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Stout and USS Jason Dunham, according to CENTCOM. ""The Strike Group is deployed to ensure regional stability and security,"" CENTCOM said on Dec. 15. The incident comes as U.S. forces have continued to mount a defense against Iran-backed Houthi rebels based in Yemen, which have targeted cargo ships for missile attacks thatthreaten the global supply chain. Over the last year, U.S. forces have launched attacks against Houthi facilities and assets in Yemen, including underground storage facilities, command and control locations, missile and radar systems, and drone bases. ""We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said after U.S. forces struck Houthi weapons facilities in Yemen in November. The back and forth with the Houthis this year has included what the Navy has described asits most intense fighting since World War II. An estimated12%of global suppliespassthroughRed Sea shipping laneson a typical day. Houthis stepped up their attacks following the Oct. 7, 2023 incursion into Israel by Hamas militants based in Gaza, which was met with war on the militants by Israel with support of the United States. According to Israeli officials, about 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the incursion by Hamas militants. Hamas fighters took about 250 people hostage. Around 100 are still being held captive, according to an NBC News tally, though more than a third are believed to be dead. Since the start of the war, more than 45,000 people, most of them women and children, have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. Houthi militants said in a statement Saturday that Israel's behavior has included ""massacres against our brothers in Gaza."" On Saturday morning,a Houthi missile launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv,resulting in injuries to 14 people but no deaths, emergency services officials in Israel said. In their statement, Houthi rebels noted the missile was not thwarted by Israel's ""iron dome"" defense.

"Man shot dead by police after driving into Texas mall, striking multiple people","A man who struck multiple people after driving into a Texas mall on Saturday was shot and killed by police, authorities said. The man plowed into the front of a JC Penney store at the Killeen Mall in Killen, shattering the glass doors and continuing to drive his black pickup about 100 yards while “striking multiple people” and “actively running people over,” Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Bryan Washko said during a news conference Saturday night. He was later identified on Sunday as John Darrel Schultz, 53, of Kempner, TX. Police opened fire and fatally shot Schultz. Washko said there is no longer a threat to the community and that the Texas Rangers are investigating the police shooting. Four people were transported to local hospitals with injuries ranging from severe to minor, Washko said. He added that another person hurt in the incident walked into a hospital with minor injuries. No deaths have been reported besidesSchultz. Washko stressed that there was no active shooter at the mall, as had initially been reported and spread on social media. Killeen police also dispelled the rumor on Facebook earlier Saturday. Police were initially pursuingSchultzafter getting a report at about 5 p.m. of a possibly intoxicated driver on the highway, Washko said. The driver exited Interstate 14 and entered the Killeen Mall parking lot before driving into the store. Video from the scene showed police amassing at the shopping center. Police asked members of the public to avoid the area so first responders could have access and investigators could probe the nature of the incident. Killeen is a city about 67 miles north of Austin. Killeen Mall states on its website that it has more than 90 retailers. Rebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
Trump's plan to end daylight saving: Will 4:30 a.m. be the new American daybreak?,"Morning in Americacould, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined. President-elect Donald Trumpvowedtoend daylight saving time, a surprising pledge that, if carried through, would dramatically alter U.S. life in spring and summer months, when Americans revel in sunshine well into traditional nighttime hours. Daylight saving time tends to push sunshine to later hours, making for gloriously long, bright days in spring and summer months. Standard time brings more sunshine to earlier hours, insuring that children are not trudging to school in cold-weather darkness. Trump’s proposed sunset of daylight saving time, a practice long believed to be supported by U.S. business interests, stunned the medical community that’s been pushing for years to make standard time full time. Opponents of daylight saving say it can pose a risk of  mood disorders, adverse cardiovascular events and car crashes. University of California San Francisco neurologist and sleep expert Dr. Kin Yuen said she and her peer group of standard time backers still are not entirely confident in Trump’s pledge even though the president-elect's Truth Social post clearly spelled out his desire to end daylight saving time. ""I think we were all rather incredulous,"" Yuen told NBC News this week, days after Trump's post. ""So yeah, we're elated. We're catching this wave that'll hopefully get more attention and point out the health benefits of adopting permanent standard time."" The manner in which Americans adjust their clocks twice a year is outlined in theUniform Time Act of 1966,whichset parameters for daylight saving time. America most recently fell back into standard time onNov. 7 this year. During standard time in fall and winter months, Americans enjoy about 9 to 11 hours of sunshine a day, generally starting between6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. The nation springs forward to daylight saving next onMarch 9, 2025, ushering in spring and summer with 11 to 15 hours of daily sunshine that can oftenstart between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. ""There is a momentum to not have to change the clocks anymore,"" said Dr. Nathaniel Watson, a long-time advocate of permanent standard time and neurologist at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center. ""But there's this conflation of, 'Let's not change clocks and the only way to do that is go to permanent daylight savings time,' which is just not the case. It should just be standard time."" If America were to stay with standard time year-round, then sunshine during warm-weather months would hit bedroom curtains at unaccustomed early hours, perhaps between 4:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. And on the back end of summer days, the sun would set at earlier hours under standard time. During summer months, baseball games that start at 7 p.m. can often absorbseveral innings of sunshine and twilightunder daylight saving time. But those same summer-night games, if played in standard time, might only yield an inning or two of fading sunshine before stadium lights take full effect. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine formally endorsed year-roundstandard time in 2020and theAmerican Academy of Neurologyjoined on to that position in 2023. The human body functions well for 16 waking hours a day with activities best planned around""solar noon""— when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, doctors backing universal standard time have said. For most of standard time months, solar noon comes close to 12 p.m. on the wall clock.But during daylight saving months, that midpoint usually comes after 1 p.m. And employees and students who have a 9-to-5 schedule will now get up an hour earlier than their bodies would want to in relation to solar noon. ""So you are forcing your body to get up at a time much earlier. You're basically tricking your body into saying, 'Get up an hour earlier for work and school,' which is why a lot of people hate mornings,"" said Dr. Karin Johnson, a neurologist and sleep expert at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts. ""So if you were on daylight savings time [year-round], it would  makes us hate those mornings even more."" For anyone concerned about the sun peeking through window shades just a few hours after stumbling home from their local bar, Johnson said that inconvenience is a small price to pay to be in better sync with circadian rhythm. ""Do we need 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. sunrises? No, none of us would like that,"" she said. ""But you can put your face down and sleep through that. What we do need is for the sun to be in alignment with our bodies [under standard time]."" Trump's announcement was also surprising because it appears to conflict with popular sentiment and leaders of his own party. TheSenate two years agooverwhelminglypassed legislationto makedaylight saving year-round, though the bill stalled out from there. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump's pick to leadthe State Department, was one of the bill's sponsors and has been a vocal supporter ofdaylight saving time. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHF), which is funded by insurance companies,has long advocated for year-round daylight saving time. The group has said lives are saved when there's better visibility in after-work and early-evening driving hours. ""We know there’s a strong relationship between increased darkness and fatal crashes, especially when it comes to pedestrian and bicyclists,"" IIHF spokesperson  Joseph Young said in a statement this week. ""Leaving daylight saving time behind would result in earlier sunsets during the summer months, which would very likely result in more fatalities involving these road users."" Should America ever flip the switch to turn off daylight saving time,  widespread infrastructure upgrades would be necessary, according to the IIHF. ""If we do see daylight saving time come to an end, communities will need to think even harder about how to improve safety for those on foot,"" Young said. ""Better lighting and infrastructure, lower vehicle speeds, and other changes that are already badly needed will become even more crucial."" Some business interests have also advocated for daylight saving time, believing it could lead to more after-work commerce if it's not too dark. A representative for Rubio could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday, and a spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said her group has no formal position on daylight saving time. What little polling on daylight saving versus standard time has been conducted over the years seems to slightly favor daylight saving. YouGov posed the question in March 2023 and 50% of respondents said they would support permanent daylight saving time, while only 31% said they'd want year-round standard time. ""The marketing department of daylight savings time, which of course is highly connected with industries, did a much better job than we have,"" said Yuen, of UCSF. ""We naturally have more sunlight [in daylight saving months]. Whether we had daylight saving time or not, we just have longer days. And I think that we need to do a better marketing job the other way around and remind people of sitting in the dark at school in winter."" The U.S. briefly adopted year-rounddaylight saving in 1974-75, in hopes of pushing more daylight into later hours and cutting energy use during theOPEC oil embargo. But using daylight saving time in winter was wildly unpopular, with children hiking to school in darkness, and it was quickly ended. Johnson said she’s convinced poll respondents who oppose permanent standard time are conflating daylight saving with the good times of spring break and summer vacations — and forgetting about the rejection of year-round daylight saving time in 1974. ""There are huge (emotional) connections between summer and daylight savings time,"" Johnson said. ""And yes, we like it when it's warm and the days are longer. But we've tried permanent daylight savings before, the last in 1974, and it didn't work."" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., invoked the bad memories of 1974 and said he’d be willing to help Trump push for year-round standard time. ""Congress once made Daylight Saving Time permanent. It was so unpopular that Congress repealed it less than a year later,""he said in a statement. ""The only sensible and durable way to stop the biannual time change is to make Standard Time permanent."" The biggest response in that 2003 YouGov poll appeared to come from people who don't want to change their clocks in either direction, as 62% respondents said they simply wanted the elimination of either standard or daylight saving time, while 31% said they were OK with the status quo of both.

Creators on TikTok aim to help people navigate the holidays on a budget,"There was once a time that Amanda Maze, a home health nurse and mother from Kentucky, took out loans to pay for her family’s Christmas presents — a decision she said caused a “vicious cycle” of year-round payments and debt. Now, she’s teaching her half-million TikTok followers that the holidays really can be priceless, or at least closer to it. Through sharing her own experience thrifting festive decor and budgeting gifts for her and her fiancé’sfive children, Maze offers an alternative to an otherwise spend-heavy holiday season. “I think my goal is just to help people understand that things in life are only temporary,” Maze said. “You don’t have to live such a materialistic lifestyle.” She’s among a handful of TikTok creators who have ramped up content related to budgeting around the holidays in the hopes of easing the stress of those who struggle around this time. Holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah are often synonymous with elaborate meals, aesthetic decor and over-the-top gifts. Though Americans are projected to spend over $17 billion more than last year on gifts alone, more than half of the people surveyed by NerdWallet’sannual holiday spending reportsaid holiday spending “stress[es] them out.” The study also found that roughly 1 in 10 people may prioritize buying gifts over paying their bills. “People are feeling the pressure to spend on gifts, sometimes to the point of harming their ability to meet their other financial obligations,” said Sara Rathner, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. People are feeling the pressure to spend on gifts, sometimes to the point of harming their ability to meet their other financial obligations. -Sara Rathner, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. The uptick in budget-conscious holiday videos comes amid a rise in “underconsumption core,” a TikTok phenomenon that encourages people to reject the microtrends and focus on the things that they actually use and enjoy on a daily basis. Many people on the platform are also already posting videos about theirintentions to take part in a “no spend challenge”in 2025. “Ever since the underconsumption trend started, I feel like people are tired of [having] influencers throwing things in their face, and more normal people like me have started to become more popular,” said Emmy Kluemper, a content creator who has been posting TikTok videos that promote a more budget-conscious lifestyle. Kluemper said she aims to “de-influence” new audiences againstoverspending on traditions, like home decorating around the holidays. “I think on social media, sometimes it becomes normalized that every year you need to have a new Christmas aesthetic,” said Kluemper, who is the sole provider for her household. “But I think for the majority of people, that’s just not realistic.” Sarah Falls, a mom based in Darwin, Australia, said she uses TikTok to “be open and honest” about the difficulties of parenting, including buying gifts on a budget. This holiday season, she documented how she is thrifting Christmas gifts for her three children on a $150 budget. She has posted severalhauls, which have drawn both praise and scrutiny from some of her 25,000 followers. Some critics have expressed feelings of disappointment for Falls’ children. But the creator has emphasized that her kids “do not go without.” “If you are hard on money or you want to go down the sustainability track, then you have another option,” she said. “You don’t have to spend thousands of dollars for your kids to have a good Christmas.” From a financial perspective, Rathner, of NerdWallet, said it’s never too early to start planning holiday budgets and even purchasing gifts. Shopping without a plan, she said, is often the cause of overspending. “Before you set your gift list and set your budget, see if you could adjust expectations among all the people you’re going to be surrounding [the] holiday with,” she added, emphasizing that many may “suffer in silence” financially during the holidays. Kluemper shared a similar perspective, noting that it’s the thoughtful gifts that are “appreciated the most.” “It can suck the joy out of the season if you’re getting stressed about keeping up with other people,” she said. “I hope that they see the way we handle it and understand there will always be people that have more, that have the nicer, the newer, whatever it is, but you can be grateful and thankful for the season that you’re in.” Sophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News."
Raise a glass: A lot of top-shelf booze is more affordable this holiday season,"Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last — but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering. As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable. Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago,federal inflation numbersreleased Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer. And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices,accusing a major U.S. liquor distributorof favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete. So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages have been relatively modest. Booze costs rosenearly 15% from the first half of 2019to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs wereup only 1.8%since the year before, while inflationoverall was 2.7%. You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for. Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S. Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check. “It’s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. “It’s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.” That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showedmany households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers’ wallets withincreasingly competitive deals and discounts. “As a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,” Lodewijks said of inflation’s impact on alcohol in recent years. “When prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.” His firm flagged in September thatsales volumes had declinedmore than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makershave been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amidgrowing interest in nonalcoholic mocktailsand signs that younger people arethinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year. U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who havefaced a yearslong pullbackafter the previous decade’s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants,accounting for over half of booze salesin those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast. Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week’s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump — climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have beenpassing on higher coststo their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers. “While mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,” he said. “Now, consumers won’t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.” There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers’ costs. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November led somebeer makers to voice fresh worriesabout tariffs, after his first roundhit the aluminum and steel-reliant industryin 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which hadwaved offtrade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed25% tariffson goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied. In the meantime, some of the industry’s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season. The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantageas demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas — many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said. “What consumers are saying is, ‘I’m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,’” he said. Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it’s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year. Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said. Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky,according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production. “Shop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,” he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. “Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for.” Alexandra Byrne is an intern with the NBC News Business and Economy Unit."
How much is the yuletide juggernaut 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' worth,"“I don’t want a lot for Christmas / There is just one thing I need / An answer to just one question / An estimate of Mariah Carey’s song royalties, please?” No, my makeshift lyrics aren’t as catchy as the opening lines of Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” the 1994 jingle that became practically ubiquitous over the airwaves around holiday season. But they do pose a question that probes into the black box of music-industry economics: How much money does the song earn for Carey, the song’s performer and so-called “Queen of Christmas,” each year? Revenue estimates byBillboardsuggest she made perhaps $2.7 million to $3.3 million in 2022, for example, from song downloads and on-demand streaming. It excludes other potentially lucrative revenue streams like Christmas TV specials. But it’s hard to know a precise sum, largely because contractual details between Carey, her music label and song publishers aren’t public, experts said. The pop star’s publicist, Chris Chambers, didn’t return a request for comment submitted to his firm, The Chamber Group, about her royalties. “Whatever it is, it’s a lot of money,” said Natasha Chee, a music, entertainment and intellectual property attorney at law firm Donahue Fitzgerald. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is a yuletide juggernaut. Spotifyannouncedthis month that the anthem was the first-ever holiday song to surpass 2 billion global streams. It has been the No. 1 song globally on Christmas Day each year since 2016, Spotify said. The tune’s popularity has only grown: Total U.S. audio streams rose to 249 million in 2023, up about 49% from 167 million in 2019, according to Luminate, which tracks music industry data. (As of Dec. 12, total U.S. streams of the song this year were down 8% relative to 2023, Billboard estimated. That’s partly a function of the shorter holiday season from a late Thanksgiving, experts said.) The song “is a money machine,” said George Howard, a professor at the Berklee College of Music and former president of Rykodisc, an independent record label. “It’s a real phenomenon,” he said. Howard, who also does consulting work to value music copyrights, estimates the chart-topper makes $2 million to $4 million in annual gross revenue. Similarly, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, which specializes in music industry law, estimates the hit generates $3.4 million a year. Over its 30-year existence, the song has made about $103 million in earnings, the law firm estimates. The projections include global streaming and non-streaming revenue sources, according to Manatt, which created Billboard’sroyalty calculator. The song’s 2 billion global Spotify streams alone earned $9.8 million in royalties, according to the calculator. But Carey only gets a portion of those earnings. The ecosystem of music royalties is notoriously convoluted. Money flows to many contributors, like writers, performers, producers, sound mixers and record labels. Payouts to each person can vary from song to song, depending on contractual terms, experts said. The terms of Carey’s royalty deals aren’t public knowledge. The singer is likely getting a “bigger chunk” of revenue than most artists, Howard said. That’s because of Carey’s multiple credits on the song: She’s listed as the sole performer, as well as its co-writer and co-producer. (Walter Afanasieff is the other co-writer and co-producer.) Such a multitude of credits is unusual to see, Howard said. And it’s an important factor in Carey’s ultimate take-home pay. Music royalties are different from those of other works like books or photography. That’s because there are two distinct royalty streams — one for music composition and another for sound recording, said Jordan Bromley, partner and head of Manatt Entertainment. Think of the former like the sheet music sitting on your piano (the songwriting), and the latter as the recorded song that you hear, he said. Each has its own royalty structure. The royalties for music composition are received by songwriters and publishers, while those for sound recording are paid to song performers and their labels, Howard said. Carey “has both the copyright to the song and the sound recording, so she’s getting paid on both sides,” Howard said. “She’s getting paid six ways to Sunday,” he said. A song’s writers and publishers — and not its performers — get the royalties when a song plays in a public space, such as on TV and radio, or in restaurants and retail stores, experts said. The U.S. is one of the few countries to have such a rule, Howard said. This means that Carey (and Afanasieff, her co-writer) gets royalties whenever a cover version of “All I Want for Christmas Is You” plays in the public domain. Over 150 performers have covered the song,accordingto ASCAP, a performing rights organization. Carey and Afanasieff split their writing credits with publishers including Universal Music, Sony Music and Kobalt Songs Music Publishing,accordingto ASCAP. However, song recording generally brings in four to five times the revenue of songwriting, Bromley said. “If you’re a songwriter with no record revenue, it’s hard to make a living even if you’re making hits,” he said. The artist’s take of the recording revenue relative to the label’s can swing widely, anywhere from 20% up to 90%, depending on the contract, Bromley said. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” was released by Columbia Records, which is owned by Sony Music. Afanasieff, Sony Music and Kobalt Songs Music Publishing didn’t return requests for comment. Universal Music Publishing Group declined comment. Experts note that earnings from record sales and licensing can vary greatly from year to year, while revenue from streaming and performance is more predictable. Of the aforementioned estimated $8.5 million in global revenue and publishing royalties that “All I Want for Christmas Is You” earned in 2022, the Carey master recording brought in $5.3 million and publishing royalties accounted for the remaining $3.2 million, Billboard said. What was Carey’s cut? She made about $1.9 million of the master recording revenue, Billboard estimated, while her label, Sony, kept the other $3.4 million. Carey also earned an estimated $1.6 million of the publishing, assuming she and Afanasieff split the writing 50-50. But her take-home pay would have been less, depending on her publishing deal — perhaps ranging from about $795,000 to $1.4 million, Billboard said. All told, these estimates suggest Carey may have made about $2.7 million to $3.3 million from recording and publishing in 2022. This excludes revenue from any financial arrangements for soundtracks from Christmas TV specials, which are likely lucrative, according to Billboard. It also excludes cover versions of the song. “There’s a ton of revenue that opens up” for a pop star who is almost “co-branded” with Christmas, including deals for brand endorsements, live performances, cosmetics, home goods and apparel, Manatt Entertainment’s Bromley said. The song is the gift that will keep keep on giving for years, experts said. The copyright for works published after Jan. 1, 1978, generally remainsintactfor the author’s lifetime, plus 70 years after the author’s death, according to Chee of Donahue Fitzgerald. In the case of a joint work with two or more authors, such as “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” the rule applies to the last surviving author. That means Carey’s estate will likely rake in royalties for decades, until the song eventually passes into the public domain, she said. When that happens, the song would join the ranks of Christmas classics like “Jingle Bells” and “We Wish You a Merry Christmas,” which can generally befreely shared and adapted."
'Nickel Boys' brings to life the notorious cruelty of a Southern reform school,"Film director RaMell Ross is unapologetic about his focus on the Black South in his work. His first feature-lengthdocumentary, “Hale County This Morning, This Evening,”captures the educational experiences, the class struggles and the reverberations of Jim Crow segregation in an Alabama community, earning him an Oscar nomination in 2019. “Nickel Boys,” Ross’ first narrative feature, falls in line with his professional and personal mission. He and producer Joslyn Barnes adapted the film from Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2019 novel, “The Nickel Boys.” The story is set at the fictional Nickel Academy, based on thenotoriously cruel Arthur G. Dozier School for Boysnear Tallahassee, Florida, which operated for 111 years before being shut down by the Department of Justice in 2011. Far worse than the white children in the institution’s charge, Black children were physically and emotionally abused in the hundreds with no accountability.Nearly 100 teens and boys— and possibly more — died on its grounds, with many buried in unmarked graves. “It seemed perfect for me to adapt,” said Ross, who lives part time in Alabama. “I was a Black boy, and I can see myself specifically in Elwood because I grew up with a lot of love. I was a really, really, really good kid because I was afraid something small would happen and it would just escalate, and life would be derailed, and I’d let my parents down and everything they’ve done would go to waste.” For Ross, “Nickel Boys” is also very much tied to his acclaimed documentary. “I think I made an unintentional proof of concept when I made ‘Hale County This Morning, This Evening,’ and the aesthetics of this film are an evolution of that,” he admitted. Of the two main characters in “Nickel Boys,” Jack Turner, played by Brandon Wilson, is more seasoned and he befriends the more naïve Elwood Curtis, whose bright future as a college student in the early 1960s ends when he accepts a ride from an older Black man in a stolen car. Turner and Elwood offer the audience entry into the heinous world of Nickel, a segregated juvenile correctional facility for boys. Unlike Turner, Elwood, played by Ethan Herisse, has a loving grandmother Hattie, played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, who does her best to protect him as a child and fights to free him from Dozier. Ross said it was important that the actors playing Elwood and Turner seem timeless. “There’s something about making historical productions or exploring history in which we over-index on the symbolism, the speech, the clothing and the background, the environment, that pushes it into this bizarre capsule of history,” he explained. “I would argue there’s something unconscious that happens, in which you’re like, ‘They’re not like us. They’re not the exact same as us. Or there’s something different. Times were different,’” he continued. “We were insistent on finding two boys that felt like now, that could also feel like then, which is kind of now, which is also then.” Ross also shared his awe of Ellis-Taylor, whom he, along with Herisse and Wilson, presented the Social Impact Award for their film during the Critics Choice Association Celebration of Black Cinema & Television in Los Angeles this month. “She actually lives the character, which is a little bit distressing when the scenes are really, really emotional because we shoot them four or five times,” he said. But Ellis-Taylor knows it is part of the job. “This is the kind of work that I want to do,” said Ellis-Taylor, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in 2021’s “King Richard,” and is beginning to receive Oscar buzz for “Nickel Boys.” “I’m beyond blessed to work with someone like RaMell Ross, to work with Ethan Herisse, to work with Brandon Wilson, and to be a part of storytelling that I feel gives some justice to those children at the Dozier School.” Determining how to present the brutality of this painful history without glorifying it or morphing it into trauma porn was a huge challenge for Ross, who is more than aware of how irresponsibly violence against Black bodies has historically been captured in photography, film and even on the news. In contrast, Ross pondered ways to capture how “somatic, psychological and completely absorbed” that brutality is. It comes through in the way the film is shot through various characters’ point of view. Accolades for Ross indicate that the critics like his approach. He’s already won best director honors from the Gotham Awards and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and received a Critics Choice Awards nomination. As a film, “Nickel Boys,” which also stars Daveed Diggs in a small but important role, has received several best picture nods, including the Golden Globes. “The story is pretty heartbreaking,” Ross admitted, but added that “I think the ending is ultimately hopeful.” He sees it as “the sort of redemption that a lot of folks are looking for when they watch” a sad, heavy film. However, that hope, he shared, “comes in a way that’s more conceptual.” Atlanta-based writer Ronda Racha Penrice is the author of ""Black American History For Dummies."""
Kerry Washington's 'Six Triple Eight' shows the important role Black women played in WWII,"The job was considered impossible: Clear 17millionpieces of backlogged mail. In a war zone. Maj. Charity Adams knew it was a mission that could not fail, not just for the sake of morale of World War II troops, but also for the reputation of Black people in the eyes of the country’s top military brass. The real-life efforts of the 855 women of theWomen Army Corps’ 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalionare captured in Tyler Perry’s latest film, “Six Triple Eight,” streaming now on Netflix. To Kerry Washington, who portrays Adams, the battalion’s ability to resolve an ongoing problem in the face of discrimination while also being underestimated by others around them felt like both a herculean task and an all-too-familiar scenario. “When these women were asked to solve this problem, it was a problem that lots of people had tried to fix, and nobody could,” Washington said in an interview with NBC News. “They came in and, as Black women do, they figured out how to fix a situation that seemed impossible to fix, and by doing so, they returned hope and purpose and belonging and love to the soldiers to help end the war.” Mary McLeod Bethune, head of the National Council of Negro Women and a member of what was known as President Franklin Roosevelt’s “Negro Cabinet,” whom Oprah Winfrey plays in the film, advocated for Black women to serve in the war. But while Black women were admitted to the military, they were segregated from white women and given very little to do. Because top military brass deemed Black people generally inferior, many doubted a successful outcome to clearing endless piles of mail. “Back then, mail was how you stayed connected to the people you love,” Washington said. “There was no WhatsApp, no texting, no emailing, no FaceTiming. Rarely could you get to a landline phone. People didn’t have cellphones, so mail was it,” she said. “So when soldiers weren’t getting mail, they no longer had hope. They had lost their sense of purpose.” The unit’s work had been forgotten by most — even Perry, the director, did not know about the 6888th’s work until producer Nicole Avant contacted him about taking it on. During a Q&A last month after a screening of the film on his home turf, Atlanta, Perry told the crowd, filled with members of the National Association of Black Military Women, how meeting Lena Derriecott Bell King, then 99, a member of the 6888th, showed him that he could apply her life experiences to help tell the remarkable story. Perry was also fortunate to screen an early version of the film for King before she died on Jan.18, nine days shy of her 101st birthday. To play 17-year-old Lena Derriecott, Perry tapped Ebony Obsidian, who stars in his long-running series “Sistas” on BET. The role came as a surprise to Obsidian. When he asked her to read the script, she did not realize it was a true story or that he wanted her in his film. “I hadn’t even thought about me playing Lena when I read the script,” she said with Washington by her side. Obsidian, whose other credits include the Barry Jenkins film “If Beale Street Could Talk” and the Hulu series “Wu-Tang: An American Saga,” admits she was worried about portraying the lead but said she was honored Perry would select her. Her mother’s urging and reminder of her childhood nickname, “Little Soldier,” helped persuade her “to take this no matter how intimidating it is,” she said. “Meeting with Lena was the biggest gift,” Obsidian added. “She obviously was 100 years old when I met her, but at 17, I feel like there are certain elements about her that had to be the same, that had to just be noble.” Washington did not get to meet the real Adams, who died in 2002 at age 83, but she still felt guided by her. “She passed, but she wrote a really beautiful memoir called ‘One Woman’s Army’ that I read a couple times,” Washington said. “I devoured it, and I used to have portions of the memoir hanging up in my dressing room. I surrounded myself with pictures of her and watched archival footage and interviewed people who knew her and worked with her and listened to old interviews. I just really tried to submerge myself in as much of her soul and essence as I could.” Washington said finding the commander’s actual trunk from World War II, containing her clothes and handwritten notes, outside her dressing room after having rehearsed one of Adams’ monologues with Perry felt like an approval. But how Washington speaks in the film has generated the most interest, including from her own kids, who asked, “Whose voice is that?” after she played them the trailer. To achieve that distinctive voice, which sounds like a sharp Southern twang punctuated by precise Midwestern enunciation, perhaps reflecting Adams’ South Carolina upbringing and schooling at Wilberforce University in Ohio, Washington worked hard with both an accent coach and her acting coach. “They didn’t have amplification back then. It wasn’t like she was standing there with a karaoke machine,” she said. “So if I had the kind of responsibility and command and calling that she had, where would that live in my body? How would that impact my posture? How would it impact my voice? How would it impact my resonance and my need to be heard by these women so that they felt seen and heard by me? Those are some of the questions that I asked to help me figure out where that vocal performance came from.” Washington and Obsidian said they are grateful to be at the center of a film celebrating Black women’s strength, excellence and sisterhood, which Obsidian said also shows that “you can overcome anything you need to overcome with the right support and the right people by your side.” Washington said: “It’s really exciting to be part of, in some ways, corrective history. We are telling a story that has been pushed into the margins about some true heroes, not just American heroes, but heroes of democracy all over the world.” Atlanta-based writer Ronda Racha Penrice is the author of ""Black American History For Dummies."""
Key warning signs about bird flu are all going in the wrong direction,"The simmering threat of bird flu may be inching closer to boiling over. This year has been marked by a series of concerning developments in the virus’ spread. Since April, at least 64 people have tested positive for the virus — the first U.S. cases other than a single infection in 2022. Dairy cow herds in 16 states have been infected this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the country’s first severe bird flu infection on Wednesday,a critically ill patient in Louisiana. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared astate of emergency this week in response to rampant outbreaksin cows and poultry. “The traffic light is changing from green to amber,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases. “So many signs are going in the wrong direction.” No bird flu transmission between humans has been documented, and the CDC maintains that the immediate risk to public health is low. But scientists are increasingly worried, based on four key signals. For one, the bird flu virus — known as H5N1 — has spread uncontrolled in animals, including cows frequently in contact with people. Additionally, detections in wastewater show the virus is leaving a wide-ranging imprint, and not just in farm animals. Then there are several cases in humans where no source of infection has been identified, as well as research about the pathogen’s evolution, which has shown that the virus is evolving to better fit human receptors and that it will take fewer mutations to spread among people. Together, experts say, these indicators suggest the virus has taken steps toward becoming the next pandemic. “We’re in a very precarious situation right now,” said Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. Since this avian flu outbreak began in 2022, the virus has become widespread in wild birds, commercial poultry and wild mammals like sea lions, foxes and black bears. More than125 million poultry birds have died of infections or been culledin the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. An unwelcome surprise arrived in March, when dairy cows began to fall ill, eat less feed and produce discolored milk. Research showed the viruswas spreading rapidly and efficiently between cows,likely through raw milk, since infected cows shed large amounts of the virus through their mammary glands. Raccoons and farm cats appeared to get sick by drinking raw milk, too. The more animals get infected, the higher the chances of exposure for the humans who interact with them. “The more people infected, the more possibility mutations could occur,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and the director of the Brown University School of Public Health’s Pandemic Center. “I don’t like giving the virus a runway to a pandemic.” Until this year, cows hadn’t been a focus of influenza prevention efforts. “We didn’t think dairy cattle were a host for flu, at least a meaningful host,” Andrew Bowman, a professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University,told NBC News this summer. But now, the virus has been detected in at least 865 herds of cows across at least 16 states, as well as in raw (unpasteurized) milk sold in California andin domestic cats who drank raw milk. “The ways in which a community and consumers are directly at risk now is in raw milk and cheese products,” Chin-Hong said. “A year ago, or even a few months ago, that risk was lower.” The majority of the human H5N1 infections have been among poultry and dairy farmworkers. But in several puzzling cases, no source of infection has been identified. The first was ahospitalized patient in Missouriwho tested positive in August and recovered. Another was aCalifornia child whose infection was reported in November. Additionally, Delaware health officials reported a case of H5N1 this week in a person without known exposure to poultry or cattle. But CDC testing could not confirm the virus was bird flu, so the agency considers it a “probable” case. In Canada, a British Columbia teenager was hospitalized in early November after contracting H5N1 without any known exposure to farm or wild animals. The virus’ genetic material suggested it was similar to a strain circulating in waterfowl and poultry. Such unexplained cases are giving some experts pause. “That suggests this virus may be far more out there and more people might be exposed to it than we previously thought,” Nuzzo said. Rising levels of bird flu in wastewater To better understand the geography of bird flu’s spread, scientists are monitoring wastewater for fragments of the virus. “We’ve seen detections in a lot more places, and we’ve seen a lot more frequent detections” in recent months, said Amy Lockwood, the public health partnerships lead at Verily, a company that provides wastewater testing services to the CDC and a program calledWastewaterSCAN. Earlier this month, about 19% of the sites in the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System — across at least 10 states —reported positive detections. It’s not possible to know if the virus fragments found came from animal or human sources. Some could have come from wild bird excrement that enters storm drains, for example. “We don’t think any of this is an indication of human-to-human transmission now, but there is a lot of H5 virus out there,” said Peggy Honein, the director of the Division of Infectious Disease Readiness & Innovation at the CDC. Lockwood and Honein said the wastewater detections have mostly been in places where dairy is processed or near poultry operations, but in recent months, mysterious hot spots have popped up in areas without such agricultural facilities. “We are starting to see it in more and more places where we don’t know what the source might be automatically,” Lockwood said, adding: “We are in the throes of a very big numbers game.” Until recently, scientists who study viral evolution thought H5N1 would need a handful of mutations to spread readily between humans. But researchpublished in the journal Sciencethis month found that the version of the virus circulating in cows could bind to human receptors after a single mutation. (The researchers were only studying proteins in the virus, not the full, infectious virus.) “We don’t want to assume that because of this finding that a pandemic is likely to happen. We only want to make the point that the risk is increased as a result of this,” said paper co-author Jim Paulson, the chair of molecular medicine at Scripps Research. Separately, scientists in recent months have identified concerning elements in another version of the virus, which was found in the Canadian teenager who got seriously ill. Virus samples showed evidence of mutations that could make it more amenable to spreading between people, Hensley said. A CDC spokesperson said it’s unlikely the virus had those mutations when the teen was exposed. “It is most likely that the mixture of changes in this virus occurred after prolonged infection of the patient,” the spokesperson said. The agency’s investigations do not suggest that “the virus is adapting to readily transmit between humans,” the spokesperson added. The viral strain in the United States’ first severe bird flu case, announced on Wednesday, was from the same lineage as the Canadian teen’s infection. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the CDC is assessing a sample from that patient to determine if it has any concerning mutations. Hensley, meanwhile, said he’s concerned that flu season could offer the virus a shortcut to evolution. If someone gets co-infected with a seasonal flu virus and bird flu, the two can exchange chunks of genetic code. “There’s no need for mutation — the genes just swap,” Hensley said, adding that he hopes farmworkers get flu shots to limit such opportunities. Experts said plenty can be done to better track bird flu’s spread and prepare for a potential pandemic. Some of that work has already begun. The USDA on Tuesday expanded bulk testing of milk to a total of 13 states,representing about 50% of the nation’s supply. Nuzzo said that effort can’t ramp up soon enough. “We have taken way too long to implement widespread bulk milk testing. That’s the way we’re finding most outbreaks on farms,” she said. At the same time, Andrew Trister, chief medical and scientific officer at Verily, said the company is working to improve its wastewater analysis in the hope of identifying concerning mutations. The USDA has alsoauthorized field trials to vaccinate cows against H5N1. Hensley said his laboratory has tested a new mRNA vaccine in calves. For humans, the federal government has two bird flu vaccines stockpiled, though they wouldneed Food and Drug Administration authorization. Nuzzo said health officials should offer the vaccines to farmworkers. “We should not wait for farmworkers to die before we act,” she said. Additionally, scientists are developing new mRNA vaccines against H5N1. This type of vaccine, which was first used against Covid-19, can be more quickly tailored to particular viral strains and also scaled more quickly. Hensley’s lab in Mayreported that one mRNA vaccine candidate offered protection against the virus to ferrets during preclinical testing. Another candidate under development by the CDC and Moderna hasalso showed promising resultsin ferrets, which are often used as a model for humans to study influenza. “Now we just have to go through the clinical trials,” Hensley said.

Pro-Palestinian students sue University of Michigan over free speech issues,"The University of Michigan is being sued by current and former students who allege that the school targeted and disproportionately disciplinedpro-Palestinian students involved in campus protests. A federal lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan accuses the school of violating the students' constitutional rights to free speech, due process, and equal protection under the law. It names the university's Board of Regents, president, and vice president of student life as defendants. The University of Michigan allegedly targeted students and student groups for disciplinary proceedings, issued trespass notices that kept them from attending classes, terminated students from campus jobs, and blacklisted them from future employment, according to the lawsuit. ""No such measures are known to have been taken at any time during the previous half century by the University against students engaging in speech and other expressive activities on other important political and human rights issues,"" the lawsuit said. The University of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News. Since theHamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, many pro-Palestinian student groups have renewed protests calling for their universities todivest from Israeli corporations, defense companies, or companies that financially benefit Israel. One such protest action included in the University of Michigan suit was a sit-in in the lobby of the President’s office in November 2023. The protest was broken up by police, with the suit alleging that over ten different law enforcement departments were called in and lead to 42 arrests of students. Though the sit-in was a peaceful protest, the suit alleges that several students were injured as a result of police intervention. Zaynab Elkolaly, one of the plaintiffs, was allegedly thrown to the ground by by a University of Michigan police officer and had her hijab ripped off. Students who were at the protest were alerted in May, months later, that a complaint was filed against them for alleged violations of the Students Rights and Responsibilities. The suit alleges there were several issues with the conflict resolution process that violated the school's own written policies, including that the University of Michigan cannot be its own party in the process. A student-led panel found that none of the students were responsible for the violations and the the person who brought the complaint failed to establish that the protest disrupted university activity or that the students failed to leave when asked. But the student panel decision was personally overturned by the school's vice president of student life, the suit said. The school official allegedly shifted the burden of proof to the accused students, the suit said, which ""retroactively established an entirely different standard after the hearing had concluded and the time for the introduction of evidence had passed."" The lawsuit also alleges that a complaint against its chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine was filed by someone who was hired on behalf of the university to bring a complaint against students regarding a ""die-in"" protest. It's believed that the University of Michigan ""only ever initiated a complaint against students or student organizations when they hold views in support of divestment to stop a genocide against Palestinian people,"" the suit said.

German Christmas market attack suspect faces charges of five counts of murder; aggravated assault,"Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctoraccused of killing four women and a nine-year-old boy bydriving into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, now faces charges of five counts of murder, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault after appearing in court Saturday night. His court appearance comes as details emerge about the attack and his possible motivations. Germanprivacy laws prevent authorities from releasing the suspect's full name, though they confirmed that his first name was Taleb. Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News that al-Abdulmohsen was the suspect. The incident occurred on Friday when a black BMWplowed through the crowded market, leaving 200 people injured, about 40 of them in a critical condition. The victims are a 9-year-old boy and four women, aged 52, 45, 67 and 75. Al-Abdulmohsen bypassed security bollards—set up to prevent such attacks—with the rental vehicle and entered the crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg through a gap meant for emergency vehicles, Tom-Oliver Langhans, director of the Magdeburg police, said at a press conference Saturday. Once inside, al-Abdulmohsen drove 1,200 feet at speed into the narrow, crowded alley, knocking scores of people to the ground. Forensic scientists are probing whether he had intentionally disabled the car’s emergency braking system to maximize impact. Minutes after the attack, armed police confronted al-Abdulmohsen near the wrecked vehicle in a dramatic arrest witnessed by shocked bystanders. Magdeburg Police said investigations are ongoing and officers are appealing for witnesses to send in photos or video of the incident. At the press conference Saturday evening, officials revealed that al-Abdulmohsen had been questioned, without revealing what he had said. Nopens said the motive is still being investigated but that “the background of the act” could be linked to “dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany.” Officials said Friday that al-Abdulmohsen acted alone, which former New York State Homeland Security Advisor Michael Balboni characterized as the ""worst case scenario for security officials."" “This came out of nowhere,"" he told MSNBC's Alex Witt. ""You can monitor social media, but for the most part you’re not going to know the timing on this or what they’re going to do.” Al-Abdulmohsen had voiced anger at German police and at Germany, allegedly previously saying that, “The nation that is actively criminally chasing Islam critics to ruin their lives is the German nation.” He had first first entered Germany in 2006, sought asylum there in 2016, citing threats from Saudi Arabia, and worked at a clinic as a “specialist in psychiatry.” The clinic, in the city of Bernberg, 25 miles south of the attack, confirmed his employment to NBC News, saying that he had not been on duty since October, due to ""vacation and illness."" His online activity includes historic and recent inflammatory content on X, and he has been accused of erratic behavior by an NGO for refugees. He has aligned himself with far-right movements such as Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. When asked whether the attacker could have been stopped, Nopens said “We didn’t have the perpetrator in our focus.” Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London."
"Faith-based cost-sharing seemed like an alternative to health insurance, until the childbirth bills arrived","Health care sharing ministries advertise reimbursements for members’ medical bills. But they are largely unregulated, and most have restrictions on maternity coverage. ARDEN, N.C. — Rachel Kaplan was uninsured when she became pregnant last year. So her doctor suggested an alternative: a nonprofit called Sedera, which bills itself as a medical cost-sharing service. Sedera members pay monthly fees that get pooled together, and the organization can use the collected funds to reimburse members for medical bills. The model is somewhat akin to health insurance, but Sedera isn’t subject to the same regulations. “It seemed simple enough that we were like, ‘OK, this makes sense,’ only to find out when I tried to submit the bill from the hospital, we were denied,” Kaplan said. She and her husband, Andrew Sheffield, reached out to Sedera for reimbursement after their son, Lucas, was born in August 2023. The delivery had involved an induction, 40 hours of labor and ultimately a cesarean section — the kinds of complications that can send hospital bills skyrocketing. But to the couple’s shock, they said, Sedera told them they were ineligible, citing a policy near the end of the group’s member guidelines: Within the first year of membership, medical bills for childbirth “are not shareable.” “We basically gave Sedera our money and received nothing in return,” Kaplan said. “The rug was pulled out from underneath us.” Sedera did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Sedera is what’s known as a “health care sharing ministry,” one of more than 100 such groups in the U.S. Most are rooted in Christianity and emphasize their faith-based values. The model hasgrown in popularity and revenue in the last decade,as insurance premiums and claim denials have risen alongside soaring health care costs, fuelingdistrust of health insurance companies. The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, a trade association representing seven large ministries, said that last year, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. were members of one of these groups. An analysis from the Colorado Division of Insurance put the total at around 1.5 million. That’s compared tofewer than 200,000 people before 2010. “They are looking for a faith-based alternative to the broken insurance model,” said Katy Talento, the alliance’s executive director. “They want freedom from being forced to go to certain doctors or facilities.” Among the key differences between ministry and health insurance plans are that the latter negotiate directly with medical providers, rather than reimbursing members. Most health insurance plans are also required by law to cover various services, including for pre-existing conditions, pregnancy and preventive care, whereas ministries can restrict coverage as they see fit and have no legal obligation to reimburse members. The ministries operate in broad view of state and federal regulators and got a boost from the Affordable Care Act, which stipulated that people without insurance could avoid fines if they belonged to one of these groups.President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Dave Weldon, is a former president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. One service ministries commonly restrict is maternity care, for which many require a waiting period before a member is eligible to be reimbursed, according toa Government Accountability Office report. An NBC News analysis found that at least eight of the 10 largest ministries have such restrictions. By contrast, under the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans are required to cover pregnancy and childbirth care as essential services, even if a member becomes pregnant before their coverage starts. NBC News spoke to four families who said they were denied or struggled to get reimbursed by their health care sharing ministry for pregnancy or childbirth-related expenses. All felt they had been deceived and warned other expecting families not to join, saying that the model can be just as bad — if not worse — than the system they opted out of. Two of the country’s largest health care sharing ministries said their restrictions on maternity coverage are designed to prevent people from joining solely to get reimbursed for pregnancy or childbirth costs then leaving soon after. “The members and leaders of most ministries have set some limitations on how early in someone’s membership that bills arising from pre-existing conditions or from pregnancy are shareable under their Guidelines. Where such limitations exist, they are designed to best steward the resources of the entire membership,” Talento said. Most health care sharing ministries follow a similar model: People pay a monthly membership fee, which varies by policy but can range from around $85 to $1,300. Members are responsible for an annual “unshareable amount” of their medical bills — somewhat akin to a deductible — before the ministry will chip in. Members inform their doctor or hospital that they’re “cash pay” patients (which can result indiscounted bills), then share copies of bills and proof of payment with their health care ministry. In addition to lower monthly costs than insurance premiums, the ministries advertise networks with shared religious values that exist outside the mainstream health care system. Some outline faith-based philosophies about caring for others when they fall ill. Beyond restricting maternity coverage, many groups’ policies state that they won’t reimburse for prescriptions, routine doctor’s visits, contraceptives or mental health or substance use services. Coverage for medical conditions that predate someone’s membership is often excluded, as well. And health care sharing ministries aren’t required by law to limit out-of-pocket costs or maintain large cash reserves to cover members’ bills the way insurance companies are. At least 30 states have laws that explicitly exempt health care sharing ministries from state insurance rules, too. “The health care sharing entity has full discretion to determine whether or not they are going to pay the claim, and sometimes it just comes down to whether or not they have the money to pay it,” said JoAnn Volk, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who studies these organizations. “That cannot happen with insurance.” The lack of regulation comes with some benefits, however: Ministry members have wide latitude to choose their doctors and can easily enroll at any time of the year. For those who get bills reimbursed in a timely manner, the experience can be largely positive. Still, some experts and state regulators say many health care sharing ministries promise more than they deliver ortake advantage of people seeking affordable coverage, in some casesgiving consumers the false impressionthat they are entitled to reimbursements or arepurchasing insurance plans. “The way they’re marketed and designed, many people buy them thinking they’re insurance and not realizing what the differences are,” Volk said. As nonprofits, many ministries file publicly accessible finance documents with the Internal Revenue Service. Volk and a colleagueanalyzed those formsfrom six ministries and found that their reported spending — usually a combination of reimbursements to members and internal operating expenses — often exceeded revenue. “This raises questions about the adequacy and stability of funding available to cover members’ health care costs,” the researchers wrote. Part of Sedera’s appeal to Kaplan was joining a supportive community — something she prioritizes in her everyday life. She and Sheffield live outside of Asheville, North Carolina, two doors down from Sheffield’s parents. Kaplan teaches yoga on Saturdays and is on a first-name basis with the cashier at her local grocery store. The couple owns a small painting company, but they determined that it would be too expensive to get a group insurance plan through the business or to purchase an individual plan. Sedera’s $147 monthly fee seemed like the best option. “I thought I had done all my homework,” Sheffield said. Now, the couple blames themselves for not noticing the maternity policy — located on Page 44 of Sedera’s 49-page guidelines, which are available for download on its website. Kaplan said she tried for months to get Sedera to reimburse her delivery costs, which the hospital discounted to around $7,000, without success. “It was so stressful. I was crying my eyes out. I was bawling. I was pleading with Sedera. I was calling Sedera every day,” Kaplan said. “They had no mercy for us. No grace at all.” The couple has since paid the delivery bill, along with around $2,800 for Kaplan’s anesthesia, but still owe around $2,500 for a physician’s fee. Enrollment in health care sharing ministries is not reported or tracked federally, and Colorado is the only state that requires ministries operating there to report such data. The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries sued in May to challenge that requirement,alleging it violates their religious liberty. To attract new members, some health care sharing ministries pay insurance brokers a higher commission than insurance companies do, according toa report from the Urban Institute, an economic think tank. Other people learn about the groups through church communities. That was the case for the Pelons, a family of six in Longmont, Colorado, who in 2020 became off-and-on members of Christian Healthcare Ministries — the country’s oldest and largest ministry, founded in 1981. Dana Pelon said she had a similar experience to Kaplan’s: She had recently rejoined when she found out she was pregnant unexpectedly, but Christian Healthcare Ministries only offers maternity cost-sharing for members who join at least 300 days before their due dates. Pelon was just shy of that cutoff so was told she wasn’t eligible. “There was no compassion,” she said. “It was just like, ‘Nope, we’ll cover any due date after this day.’ And it was 27 days after my daughter’s due date.’” Christian Healthcare Ministries said its maternity policy “eliminates the possibility that someone might try to ‘game’ the system by joining shortly before giving birth, having CHM members share funds to pay their medical expenses, and then leave the ministry shortly after the birth,” said Lauren Gajdek, the group’s vice president of communications. Another of the country’s largest health care sharing ministries, Liberty HealthShare, has been a target of member complaints and a lawsuit in recent years. Warren Walborn said he learned about Liberty from friends when he and his wife, Liezel Ann, were “looking for alternatives to not get killed on the premiums as insurance costs were going through the roof.” Theaverage family premium for employer-sponsored health insurancehas increased 24% since 2019, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. Walborn said he was never reimbursed for his wife’s prenatal care or the delivery of their daughter Sophie in 2021. Walborn said he submitted invoices within 180 days of medical service dates, per Liberty’s policy, but the company then requested itemized charges and additional documentation. That back-and-forth continued, he said, until the 180-day mark passed, after which point Liberty told him he was no longer eligible for reimbursement because of the time limit. “I kept fastidious records of all of these codes and everything. It was never good enough for them,” he said. “It was like … if I had hair, I would pull it all out.” “I said to myself, ‘You know, why am I sending them money every month?’” Walborn added. “‘They’re not going to ever send me anything.’” Kallie Seiter, a mother of five from Ogden, Utah, was also a member of Liberty during her pregnancy in 2019. She sent Liberty an estimate for the delivery cost at her chosen birth center ahead of time — around $5,000 — and a representative assured her in writing that it would be covered in full, according to emails reviewed by NBC News. But that was incorrect, as Seiter’s annual “unshareable amount” reset two months before her baby was born. Liberty later declined to reimburse the full sum for that reason. After a year-and-a-half dispute, Seiter succeeded in recouping her $5,000. But she left Liberty for good. “If someone were to ask me if I recommend Liberty for pregnancy, I would definitely tell them to stay far away from it,” she said. In response to an inquiry about Seiter’s and Walborn’s cases, Liberty said it is transparent about its guidelines, which members agree to when they sign up. “We regret that the processing of these members’ bills was delayed, but in an organization that receives hundreds of thousands of bills annually, processing errors may occur despite our best efforts,” said Timothy Bryan, the group’s vice president of marketing and communications. “We note these situations occurred over five years ago and Liberty has significantly improved its processes over this time period,” he added. Liberty agreed to a settlement with the Ohio attorney general in 2021 that required it to replace its top leadership, but it did not admit wrongdoing. A group of former Liberty members also sued the ministry that year, alleging that the organization had refused to pay covered medical procedures while reaping “massive profits.” Liberty said in court filings that the Ohio settlement has remedied those plaintiffs’ claims. The suit is ongoing. Weldon, Trump’s pick to lead the CDC, haspraised health care sharing ministriesfor giving consumers more options and flexibility. But he told NBC News that while president of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, he worried that bad actors could cast a negative light on the model. “I tried to promote getting all of those ministries together to develop rigorous self-policing standards,” he said, adding: “They all sort of marched to their own drummer, and I repeatedly reminded them that if they didn’t really clean their act up, that they were going to be regulated by 50 different [state] governments.” Indeed, some state officials and other groups have tried to limit the ministries’ reach. The American Hospital Association sent a warning about the ministries to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year.More than a dozen state insurance departments haveissued consumer alertsabout the ministries. And over the last five years, some state regulators and attorneys general have taken a range of legal actions against a few health care sharing ministries, accusing them of misrepresenting their plans. On the federal level, Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., reintroduced a bill last year that would require health care sharing ministries to submit annual financial disclosures to the IRS and other regulators, but the bill hasstalledin committee. Trump’s last presidential administration was somewhat friendly to health care sharing ministries. Talento worked for the White House during that term, and as president, Trumpissued an executive ordercalling on the treasury secretary to consider making payments to health care sharing ministries tax deductible. The Treasury Department proposed such a change, but it was never finalized. Volk said the effort could be revived under the new administration. She also worries that more people might enroll in ministries after a tax credit for certain insurance premiums expires as expected next year. Families who have left the ministries hope their stories will dissuade others from joining. Kaplan and Sheffield said the bills they had to pay without reimbursement from Sedera have made them question whether to have a second child. The couple remains uninsured. “We want to have another one, but not the way we did it, not how it happened,” Kaplan said. “Shouldn’t we want to have a family?” she added. “The system makes it so difficult.” This article was produced in collaboration with the USC AnnenbergCenter for Health Journalism’s 2024 National Fellowship Fund for Reporting on Child Well-being.

Man pleads guilty to giving dog fentanyl and stabbing it to death,"A Massachusetts man pleaded guilty to giving his dog fentanyl before stabbing the animal to death earlier this year. Jonathan Paluzzi, 45, of Kingston, received a sentence of five to seven years in state prison after entering a guilty plea to two counts each of animal cruelty and witness intimidation, the Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office said Friday. Paluzzi was arrested on Jan. 31after a 911 call to his Kingston Collection Way apartment. A caller reported hearing noises including shuffling and a dog whining, followed by silence. Police found the body of Paluzzi’s dog, a 60-pound bull-terrier mix named Brutus, with stab wounds. Paluzzi was initially charged with animal cruelty and possession of a Class A drug. Authorities said Paluzzi had tried to have Brutus euthanized by a veterinarian, but the animal care center refused because the dog was healthy. He then tried to poison Brutus by giving him fentanyl. When this also failed to kill the dog, authorities said Paluzzi fatally stabbed him with a set of bent grill prongs. Paluzzi’s parentstold NBC10 Bostonafter his arrest that he loved Brutus and tried to give the animal up because he was trying to go into rehab. “They were joined at the hip,” Paul Paluzzi said Tuesday about his son and Brutus. “Anytime my son would leave to go out or have a smoke or he put down his dog food, he wouldn’t touch it until John came back.” His mother, Janice Paluzzi, said her son wanted to combat his drug addiction but realized his parents couldn’t take care of the dog on their own. “'I’m sick and tired of getting high, taking advantage of you guys, and feeling like this,’ and he said, ‘So I’ll have to put Brutus down,’” she said. Paluzzi’s parents said he was high on fentanyl when he killed the animal, and they’re praying he gets the help he needs. Prosecutors noted that the high end of Paluzzi’s sentencing range, seven years, is the maximum penalty for animal cruelty under Massachusetts law."
Pacific welcomes winter with XL waves and high surf alerts from Hawaii to California,"SAN DIEGO — Winter charged on day one Saturday, as a dangerous northwest swell raced across the Pacific and triggered high surf alerts from Hawaii to California. The most urgent big-wave alert, a high surf warning, is in effect for parts of Hawaii, including surfing's mecca, the North Shore, where waves of 50 feet are possible Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The warnings are issued when waves pose a threat to life and property, the weather service says. The same swell will start to impact the coast from Santa Barbara County in California to the U.S.-Mexico border Saturday night, with a high surf advisory — issued as an alert to stay out of the water — scheduled for 10 p.m. through early Wednesday, the weather service said. The biggest waves in Southern California could reach 13 feet and will likely be found in San Diego County, it said. Big waves were also forecast for the West Coast up to the U.S.-Canada border, with the weather service in Seattle calling for waves as high as 30 feet and the office that covers Portland, Oregon, predicting waves as high as 33 feet. The ocean energy inspired organizers of one of surfing's premier competitions, The Eddie Big Wave Invitational, to give the event a tentative green light for Sunday at Waimea Bay on Oahu, with confirmation expected at first light that morning, contest director Liam McNamara said. Speaking to NBC affiliateKHNL of Honoluluon Friday, McNamara said the swell has consistently produced bigger waves than forecast in recent days. The conditions-dependent contest, which has run 10 times in 40 years, requires waves of at least 20 feet as measured Hawaiian-style, or from the back of the wave, which means wave faces can measure twice that. “We are anticipating one of the biggest swells ever,"" McNamara said Saturday onFacebook. Kevin Wallis, director of forecasting at wave prediction service Surfline,said on its websiteSaturday that a satellite recently measured a wave at nearly 66 feet off Hawaii. ""That’s the largest satellite-verified wave height reading I can remember seeing in 25 years at Surfline,"" he said. Honolulu officials, who govern the island of Oahu, said serious preparations for the Eddie were underway, with traffic barricades and signs to be erected Saturday night and lifeguard stations scheduled for full staffing on Sunday. Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference Friday that an unprecedented crowd of as many as 50,000 was expected on the beach to view the contest on Sunday. ""If you are not an experienced ocean-goer, you are strongly urged to stay away from the ocean and shorelines along the north and west-facing shores during this high surf period,"" the city of Honolulu said in a statement. Officials urged those who want to see the contest to stay home, watch it on television or online, or use public transportation and pay attention to lifeguards' announcements as waves may breach traditional boundaries and pull people into the sea. Kurt Lager, acting director of the Honolulu Ocean Safety Department, said waves washed into spectators at Waimea Bay during last year's Eddie, and this could happen again but with greater reach on Sunday. ""We’re expecting that to happen again as the surf builds through the day,"" he said at Friday's news conference. ""It could possibly be unprecedented how far the waves will wash into the park."" The contest is named for the first North Shore lifeguard, Eddie Aikau, a big-wave surfer who lost his life at age 31 in 1978 as he participated in a voyage to prove Polynesian people could travel long distances, in this case from Hawaii to Tahiti, in traditional, double-hulled canoes called hōkūleʻa’s. Just hours out of port, Aikau volunteered to paddle several miles to nearby Lanai Island on his surfboard after the canoe took on water and overturned in stormy weather,according to the Associated Press. He was never seen again. As a top big-wave surfer, lifesaver and champion of the indigenous culture that brought surfing to the world, Aikau's memory is revered, with the mantra ""Eddie would go"" signifying his willingness to drop into the scariest waves but also to take on worthy challenges. The contest drew properly sized waves last year and surprised the world when a lifeguard who was on-duty during the event, 27-year-old Luke Shepardson, beat out the world's elite big wave surfers to take the men's trophy. Invitees this year include 11-time world champion Kelly Slater, as well as big-wave legends such as Mason Ho, Peter Mel and Ross Clarke-Jones. Last year, women were invited for the first time. This year, big wave icon Keala Kennelly, top pro Justine Dupont and ""queen of Pipeline"" Moana Jones Wong are among those tapped. McNamara on Friday told KHNL that Aikau's brother, surfer Clyde Aikau, participated in the decision to hold the contest in Eddie's memory on Sunday. Lager, of Honolulu Ocean Safety, said winner Shepardson was invited to return to competition Sunday alongside three other Oahu lifeguards who made the field. Surfline said the weekend's big waves were being churned up by two  winter storms in the North Pacific that spin counterclockwise as they send swell and rain in the direction of the U.S. West Coast. On the Surfline website, Wallis characterized the latest storm as ""a beast."" Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
Trump taps former producer of 'The Apprentice' as special envoy to U.K.,"WASHINGTON — President-electDonald Trumpon Saturday announced his intent to appoint his former producer from ""The Apprentice"" to serve as special envoy to the United Kingdom. Mark Burnett has received three-dozen Emmy nominations, winning the award for about a third of those, according to theTelevision Academy's website. Trump has previously praised Burnett during campaign trail appearances. ""With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,"" Trump said in his post toTruth Social. ""Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges,"" the president-elect added. Besides ""The Apprentice,"" Burnett has worked as a top producer on ""Shark Tank,"" ""The Voice"" and ""Survivor."" Trump also cited Burnett's previous experience at MGM. Several of those shows, including ""The Apprentice,"" aired on NBC. NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC and NBC News. Trump became a reality-TV star during his time hosting ""The Apprentice"" from 2004 to 2015, and Burnettlaunchedthe show with Trump. The show helped boost the now president-elect's fame in the run-up to his first bid for the White House. Burnett is the latest in a string of selections withpersonal tiesto the president-elect. Trump previously announced he was picking his two daughters' fathers-in-law, Charles Kushner and Massad Boulos, to serve asambassadorto France and senior adviser on Arab and Middle East issues, respectively. Trump has also tapped several others with TV ties — frequently those who have appeared on Fox News — for prominent positions, including former Fox News hostPete Hegsethfor secretary of defense, though controversies threaten to derail his confirmation. Special envoys often focus on a particular issue. Trump previously announced that he had selected Warren Stephens as the ambassador to the Court of St. James, ""a role in which he will act as our Representative to the United Kingdom"" if confirmed by the Senate, the president-elect said ina postto Truth Social earlier this month.

Wintry weather hits the Northeast on first day of the season,"People in the Northeast woke up to the sight of snow on thefirst day of winter Saturday, despite the news that awhite Christmas is not expectedlater this week. Snowfall totals ranged from a dusting to six inches, with the highest total — 9.4 inches — in Milton, Massachusetts. Snow showers moved off shore thanks to a strong cold front that's hanging over the region Saturday afternoon, with daytime highs staying 10-20 degrees below average. More snow is possible Saturday night in parts of the mid-Appalachians and Great Lakes, where scattered Winter Alerts remained in place into the afternoon. These areas could see an additional dusting to up to two inches of snow. Breezy winds up to 35 mph are also expected Saturday. Due to the cold temperatures, freeze alerts are in effect for northeast Florida and southeast Georgia Saturday night. Cold Weather Advisories are also in place in isolated parts of New York, western Massachusetts and northeast Pennsylvania for Saturday night. On the other side of the country, heavy rain is pouring down in northern California all the way up through Washington state, and mountain snow is falling from the Cascades to the Sierra Nevada, and will eventually make its way to the northern Rockies. The rain and mountain snow will continue in the region as low pressure systems move onshore. Higher elevations should expect a couple of fresh inches of snow, while rainfall totals through Sunday range from 0.5-3 inches. Wind is also plaguing the west, with gusts up to 65 mph possible. Alerts are in place for parts of California, Oregon and Wyoming. Temperatures throughout the western half of the country will soar 10-25 degrees above average Saturday, with records possible in Phoenix, Tucson, Palm Springs and Las Vegas. By Sunday, this warmer air will spread over the Plains, with highs as much as 30 degrees warmer than average. Potential records on Sunday include Tucson, San Jose, Phoenix and Palm Springs. The warm air will gradually shift over the lower 48 states of the U.S. throughout the week, with highs 10-20 degrees above average in the west and central U.S. by Monday. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be warm, with highs throughout the country at or above average. In some places through the Plains and the Mississippi Valley, temperatures will be as much as 20 degrees above average. The warmer weather probably means there won't be a white Christmas, but a snowy holiday is possible in some areas of the country, and a wintry Christmas Eve iseven more likely.

Suspect in Germany auto attack that killed 5 self-identified as Islamophobic and anti-immigrationist,"The suspect in the German car-ramming attack thatkilled five and injured more than 200 on Fridayhas been identified as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a self-described member of the “liberal opposition” to Saudi Arabia who has voiced stronganti-Islamic and anti-immigrationviews. Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter identified al-Abdulmohsen as the suspect. The car allegedly driven by al-Abdulmohsen plowed 1,200 feet into a crowd in a narrow alley in Magdeburg, a city of about 240,000 people west of Berlin, where shoppers had gathered Friday night. The victims include four adults and a 9-year-old child. Al-Abdulmohsen, a doctor from Saudi Arabia who lived in Germany,sought asylum there in 2016, citing threats from Saudi Arabia, before working at a clinic as a “specialist in psychiatry.” But his online activity includes historic and recent inflammatory content on X, and he has been accused of erratic behavior by an NGO for refugees. He has aligned himself with far-right movements such as Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, while praising figures likeDutch far-right leader Geert Wilders. Police have not released a motive in the Christmas market attack, but two senior U.S. officials told NBC News authorities are investigating whether the incident is terrorism-related. Al-Abdulmohsen has been remanded into custody. German prosecutors have said they are planning to file homicide and attempted homicide charges as well as aggravated assault counts, the senior U.S. officials said. Al-Abdulmohsen’s bio on his X account, verified by NBC News, says, “Germany wants to Islamize Europe.” In December, he retweeted an X event titled “Islam — a worldwide problem,” and in November, he retweeted a post claiming “Islam is not a religion.” The same month, he also retweeted Alice Weidel, co-chairwoman of the far-right Alternative for Germany, who accused former Chancellor Angela Merkel of causing “serious damage” to Germany, blaming her for “uncontrolled mass immigration.” In November, al-Abdulmohsen called Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, a “true hero” on X. Wilders has been criticized as Islamophobic for comparing the Quran to Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and calling Moroccans “scum.” After the suspect was revealed by authorities as a Saudi national, but before his anti-Islam, far right politics were publicized, Wilders seized on the incident to add fuel to the polarizing debate on immigration, calling it “another barbaric attack in Europe — this time by a man from Saudi Arabia.” “They hate us. They despise our values. They kill us. And our children. We have to stand up,” Wilders posted on X, adding, “I’ve been saying it for over 20 years: stop with those open borders.” Wilders has not publicly commented on the incident since. The German police declined to comment on al-Abdulmohsen’s X account due to the ongoing investigation. Officials said Friday that al-Abdulmohsen acted alone, which former New York State Homeland Security Advisor Michael Balboni characterized as the “worst case scenario for security officials.” “This came out of nowhere,” he told MSNBC’s Alex Witt. “You can monitor social media, but for the most part you’re not going to know the timing on this or what they’re going to do.” In 2019, al-Abdulmohsen told the newspaper FAZ that he left Islam in his early 20s after pretending he was still a Muslim. He explained that when he registered on Twitter, his intent was “only to criticize Islam.” The Salus clinic at the Bernburg psychiatric hospital confirmed in an email to NBC News that the suspect used to work for it as a specialist in psychiatry and was off-duty since the end of October due to “vacation and illness.” The NGO Aid for Secular Refugees stated Saturday that “in 2019, members of Secular Refugee Aid filed a complaint with the police following the vilest slander and verbal attacks by (al-Abdulmohsen),” adding it was “unable to find any reason to explain his defamation campaign and the aggressiveness of his accusations.” Al-Abdulmohsen also posted a video where heused an AI avatar of Elon Musk to criticize the German government for what he said was its suppression of free speech and enabling the abuse of Saudi refugees. He had previously reposted the tech billionaire, whoexpressed his support for AfD last week, writing on X: “Only the AfD can save Germany.” Freddie Clayton is a freelance journalist based in London.

"Biden signs government funding bill, averting shutdown crisis","WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed a government funding bill on Saturday, formally averting a shutdown crisis after Congress passed the bill. The package funds the government at current levels through March 14 and includes $100 billion in disaster aid and a one-year farm bill. It did not include a debt limit extension demanded by President-elect Donald Trump. ""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity."" ""That’s good news for the American people, especially as families gather to celebrate this holiday season,"" he added. The Senatepassedthe funding bill overnight on Saturday, shortly after the House passed the bill. TheSenate votewas 85-11, and the House vote was 366-34. On Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden supported the legislation that ultimately passed Congress. “While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster relief that the President requested for the communities recovering from the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to operate at full capacity,” Jean-Pierre said in Friday’s statement. The bill’s signing caps off a chaotic few days that began when Trump and his ally Elon Musk publicly opposed the initial bipartisan deal, effectively killing it. As the two men vocally opposed the deal, Republicans in Congress swiftly echoed their criticism. Trump, however, also urged Republicans to extend or abolish thedebt ceiling, a request that did not make it into the final bill. Earlier this week, Trump threatened primaries for Republicans who defied his push to extend the debt limit. Republicans, however, still overwhelmingly supported the final bill. After the initial bipartisan deal fell apart, theHouse failedto pass a new funding bill on Thursday, when a vast majority of Democrats and a few dozen Republicans voted it down. Jean-Pierre on Thursday accused Republicans of “doing the bidding of their billionaire benefactors at the expense of hardworking Americans,” slamming the party for derailing the initial bipartisan agreement.

Are electric blankets safe? Experts weigh in,"There are tons ofbeddingoptions to choose from, and whencold weatherhits, buying an electric blanket — also known as a heated blanket — might be the best decision you can make. Heated blankets have small wires running along the inside, which useelectric heatto radiate warmth. While ideal for battling freezing-cold temperatures, they can also pose a safety hazard when you use them improperly, according to experts I spoke with. For guidance on how to use an electric blanket without risk, and to learn more about who can most benefit from one, I spoke withfire safetyexperts and a board-certified pediatrician. SKIP AHEADHow I picked the best electric blankets|The best electric blankets|How to shop for an electric blanket|Why trust NBC Select? I spoke with fire safety experts for their input on safety practices, here’s everything I kept in mind when curating this list: The FCC regulates electronic consumer goods that can emit radio frequencies to make sure they are compliant with the company’s rules, according to theFCC. A few blankets may also have certification fromUnderwriters Laboratories(UL), another quality assurance company. “The UL Listed seal means that the product has been tested to nationally recognized safety and sustainability standards,” says Robert O’Brien, president atNY Fire Consultants, Inc. All of the blankets on this list have certification from the ETL, FCC or UL. All of the electric blankets below have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon, or at least 100 reviews on Wayfair, Target or the individual blanket’s brand sites. The Bedsure electric throw blanket comes in a range of solid colors and sizes and is made of both sherpa and flannel-style fleece for softness and warmth. The remote has four time settings, so you can use it in intervals between one and four hours. The blanket, which has 4.4-star average rating from 7,725 reviews on Amazon, is also machine-washable, according to the brand, so easy to care for after years of use. Auto shut-off:yes|Heat settings:6|Sizes:throw — king|Certification:ETL, FCC This flannel-woven throw blanket will  auto shut itself off after four hours. The blanket, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 12,456 reviews on Amazon, also functions as a regular blanket, since you can detach the controller. You can hand-wash or machine-wash it, too, as long as you remove the remote attachment, according to the brand. Make sure you completely dry it before using it again after washing for safety reasons.Auto shut-off:yes| Heat settings:3| Sizes:throw — king |Certification:ETL, FCC The Brookstone electric blanket, which has a 4,4-star average rating from 321 reviews at Target, is made of polyester and has a plush texture, according to the brand. It comes in three sizes, with the queen and king sizes coming with dual remote controls, so more than one person can use it at one. It has a 12-hour auto shut-off feature, and it’s machine washable and dryable.Auto shut-off:yes| Heat settings: 10 | Size:twin — king |Certification:ETL You can set the Beautyrest electric blanket to automatically shut off in  1 to 10-hour intervals. The king- and queen-sized blankets come with dual controllers, and all the blankets are machine washable and come in 5+ colors. They also have a subtle ribbed texture and flexible wiring. It has a 4.3-star average rating from 929 reviews on Amazon.Auto shut-off:yes| Heat settings:20| Sizes:twin — king |Certification:UL This dual-textured electric blanket from Serta is made of fleece on one side and sherpa on the other. The blanket has a controller with an LCD display that makes it easy to choose from its 10 heat settings. To clean, you can  hand wash  or machine wash it  on a delicate cycle, according to the brand. Plus, like many other options on this list, it has an adjustable auto shut-off feature, which you can set between one and 12 hours.Auto shut-off:yes| Heat settings:10| Sizes:twin — king| Certification:ETL The Westinghouse electric blanket, which has a 4.5-star average rating from 973 reviews on Amazon, is made of woven ribbed flannel on one side and sherpa on the other. It comes with a timer that you can set to go off in hourly increments and it’s both hand and machine washable and safe for tumble drying in temperatures below 86 degrees, according to the brand. Auto shut-off:yes|Heat settings:10|Size:throw — queen|Certification:ETL Here’s what to consider when shopping: Material:Many electric blankets are made of polyester and woven into flannel, fleece and/or sherpa. Some of them also have ribbed textures. You can sometimes feel the wires from the outside if it’s made with a particularly thin material like generic polyester. Size:Most electric blankets come in the same sizes as mattresses in addition to a throw size. Think about how and where you plan to use one before committing.Outlets:You usually have to plug in an electric blanket into a nearby outlet, whether close to your bed or a sofa. Depending on how you plan on using the blanket, keep in mind that you should have an outlet in arm’s reach. Intended use:While electric blankets provide warmth and comfort, they aren’t safe for everyone to use, including those who arepregnant, according to experts I spoke with. To prevent damage, you also need to handle the blankets correctly. You should  avoid bunching up the blanket, especially while it’s on and avoid using it when it’s still damp from washing. In general, electric blankets are safe for most people to use, if handled the right way. This means storing and folding properly, as well as washing and drying it completely. If you handle them improperly, yes, they could cause an electrical fire. That’s because they risk overheating if you leave them on for too long and/or if you turn  them on when they aren’t dry. This is why it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s directions for usage, maintenance and storage, says McKelvey, who also says you should always turn off electric blankets before going to sleep. That said, many electric blankets (such as the ones this list) have auto shut-off features to help avoid accidents. In line with advice that pregnant people should  avoid hot tubs due to potential harm resulting from high body temperatures, you  should also avoid using electric blankets if you’re pregnant, says Dr. Chandani DeZure, a board-certified pediatrician. She also recommends only allowing children over the age of three to use heated blankets, and not allowing them to sleep with it overnight. Some safety labels also discourage diabetic people from using them. At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Our favorite blankets to cozy up with,"Nothing satisfies me quite the same way as my favorite blanket when it gets chilly outside. Whilecomforters,duvetsandquiltsmake a bed feel complete, the best blankets go the extra mile when you just want to keep you warm while on the couch, at work or sitting outside during a game. With that in mind, I spoke with textile experts to learn more about what qualities make atrulygreat blanket. Below, I break their shopping guidance and include some top-rated options, as well as recommendations from NBC Select staff. SKIP AHEADHow I picked the best blankets|The best blankets in 2024|How to shop for blankets|Why trust NBC Select? When making this list, I spoke with textile experts about what the most important features to look for in a good blanket: All of the blankets below have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon or 100 reviews or more on their brand sites. I also included items that are direct recommendations from NBC Select staff or are from brands we regularly cover. Brooklinen sent me a sample of this windowpane-style wool throw blanket to test, and it’s now my go-to, cozy blanket when I’m feeling chilly at work. It has an amazing forest green color with a subtle, plaid-like design on it that I love. The best part: It’s incredibly soft and feels plush against my skin. Made from alpaca wool, it doesn’t shed much, and the fringe on the ends adds a classic flare, too. While I use it to stay warm in the office, it’s also a good size for being cozy on a sofa or ottoman beside a fire. Material:alpaca fibers|Maintenance:dry-clean only|Size:50 x 70 in. This Cuddle blanket from Cozy Earth has an extremely plush pile covering, making it particularly warm and fuzzy. With a 4.9-star average rating from 177 reviews on Cozy Earth, this blanket comes in a regular and oversized design and four colors.

As someone who regularly reports on bedding and textiles, I can say that cashmere, made from the fleece of goats rather than sheep, is the caviar of woven materials since it’s extremely soft and velvety. This option from Quince has four inches of fringe on the ends and comes in two sizes. The brand recommends hand-washing only with mild detergent and laying out to dry. Material:cashmere|Maintenance:hand-wash only in cold water|Size:50 x 60 in., 60 x 80 in. “I’m obsessed with this blanket,” says NBC Select editorLindsay Schneider. “It’s the pride and joy of my apartment. The different color stripes are obviously a big design statement, but I love it. It’s quite heavy so it almost feels like a weighted blanket sometimes. I just throw it on and instantly feel warmer and snuggly. My only complaint is that sometimes my nails get caught on it, which is such a bummer. I just make sure I’m super careful with it when I use it.” Material:100% cotton|Maintenance:machine wash, tumble dry|Size:50 x 70 in. This wool plaid throw, which has a 4.6-star average rating from 247 reviews on L.L. Bean comes in four colorways, each with a three-inch fringe on the ends.

If you prefer the look and feel of a waffle-knit fabric, consider this throw blanket, which has a 4.7-star average rating from 2,428 reviews at Boll & Branch. Made from long-staple cotton (which has longer fibers than more common cotton), the blanket is soft, breathable and durable. It’s pre-shrunk, and the brand recommends machine washing it in cold water with similar colors. Material: long-staple cotton|Maintenance: machine wash in cold water| Size: twin, full/queen and king/California king Recommended by NBC Select reporterZoe Malin, this grid-knit throw blanket from Brooklinen is perfect for staying cozy and warm, regardless of the time of day. “I’m deeply in love with this Brooklinen blanket and I use it every single day,” she says. “I like that it’s textured, which gives it some visual appeal when I drape it over my couch, and it’s not too thick or heavy, so it never makes me overheat. It’s gotten softer and softer over time, too. It’s machine-washable in cold water with similar colors, according to Brooklinen. Material: cotton| Maintenance: machine wash in cold water| Size: 50 x 70 in. The Ugg Whitecap blanket is made of polyester and has a plush feel, according to the brand.

Material: polyester| Maintenance: machine wash in cold water|Size: 50 x 70 in. Weighted blanketscan help you relax before bed — their gentle pressure increases your levels of melatonin and serotonin, according to NBC Select updates editorMili Godio, who previously reported on their benefits. This textured option from Bearaby helps decrease anxiety and prevent waking up randomly in the middle of the night, according to the brand. It’s made of pre-washed long-staple cotton, which makes it especially soft, and it only uses sustainable fabric to give the blanket weight, according to Bearaby.

Made from 100% polyester, this blanket resists shrinking, pilling and wrinkling, according to the brand, and it comes in muted tones. Material: polyester|Maintenance: machine wash|Size: 54 x 72 in. This fun throw blanket is ideal for kids who love themed bedding, especially ones with animals. The blanket, which has a 4.9-star average rating from 256 reviews at The Company Store, works as a blanket and a hoodie with three-dimensional appliqués resembling lions, bears, cats and foxes. This way, they can wear it  while sitting or sleeping. Material: polyester fleece| Maintenance: machine wash in cold water| Size: 45 x 60 in. There are a few important factors to remember when deciding on a blanket, whether you plan on getting it for yourself or someone else. The experts I spoke with recommend you consider the following before buying: Determine sleep type Similar to choosingbed sheets, picking a good blanket means considering what type of sleeper you are, particularly whether you tend to run hot, cold or somewhere in between, according toDeborah Young, an author, educator and textile consultant. Some materials, while soft, insulate more heat than others, so if you’re a hot sleeper, a blanket made entirely of wool may not be as good of an option for you as something more breathable like cotton. Conversely, if you’re a cold sleeper, you might benefit from something heavier, such as a weighted blanket, according to Young. Choose amaterial Wool is by far the most common material for blankets, according to Young. That said, “wool has its inherent issues, like shrinkage, itching and scratching,” she says. “And it depends on the quality of the wool.” Because of this, wool blankets are commonly not machine washable and are more labor-intensive to take care of. This is something to consider if you want warmth without demanding care. Synthetic materials (such as fleece) are better if you want something machine-washable.

NBC Select commerce editorJordan Bowmanused this speaker and loves how easy it is to manipulate audio such as the bass and treble. The Anker Power Bank, which has a 4.1-star average rating from 7,157 reviews on Amazon, is the most useful way for your giftee to keep their phone charged at all times, especially when they’re traveling or outdoors and/or don’t have access to a power outlet. What’s great about this power bank is that, unlike a portable charger, it connects to a phone without having to hold both the phone and the charger itself. It also has a built-in lightning cable that folds downwards into itself, so it’s easier to store in a bag or toiletry bag. If you have a giftee in mind that doesn’t have a TV at home or is short on space for a full home entertainment system, this mini projector is the perfect gift idea. Only around the size and shape of a can of soda, this projector turns your giftee’s phone into their own personal television set. Bowman swapped his home television for thisprojectorand hasn’t looked back since. “I love the simple setup process and the portability of the Nebula,” says Bowman. I used to think that a tool with such a particular purpose was obsolete, since you can technically shred chicken with forks or a stand mixer. However, this shredder completely changed my mind. I was immediately sold on this simple but practical gadget. If you’re shopping for a guy who cooks a lot of lean meat or protein, they can use this to shred their food in seconds. You place the chicken onto the base, secure it with the lid, and then twist to shred — the more you twist, the more shredded the chicken will be. You’ve probably seen someone with an Owala water bottle and that’s because they are both durable and sleek. The FreeSip bottle has a combination spout and straw design, which gives your recipient the option to sip or swig as they drink. It is also a great option for a guy who prefers a more portable water bottle that can fit into a cup holder or the pocket of a backpack. I’ve had myOwala Tumblerfor months, and it doesn’t get scratched or dented at all, and it's great for both still and carbonated water. I gave my parents this vegetable chopper for Christmas last year and they’ve gotten a lot of use out of it ever since. It helps save a ton of time on tediously chopping vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, bell peppers and a lot more. It has multiple attachments and blade types, meaning you can chop food in different sizes and even use it as a mandoline to make homemade potato chips and fries or thinly shaved zucchini for salads. You can also chop a bunch of vegetables into the bin below along with lettuce and use it as a salad. The popular Ninja Kitchen Slushi machine is an absolute favorite of NBC Select associate reporterBianca Alvarez, who says it’s one of the best gifts she’s ever received and given. “It’s so easy to use and is a year-round appliance your loved one can use whenever they want a frozen treat,” she says. “My family uses it on game nights for drinks, for family movie nights when we want an at-home slurpee and more so, it’s perfect for people of all ages and for hosting since it whips things up quickly and without needing much work on your end.” With the device, your giftee can make frozen margaritas, rosé, soda-based slushies and much more. All they have to do is pour their desired drink mix into the chiling cylinder on top and choose a setting to get started. If your giftee is a fan of spirits such as tequila, consider this gift set from Casamigos, which has everything they need to make their favorite cocktails. It includes two cocktail mixers — one for making traditional margaritas and another for a blackberry basil smash — and two types of salt for rimming the glass: pink Himalayan and salty sweet orange. You can even make a gift basket with this and add a bottle of tequila and a couple lowball glasses. The Instant Pot electric pressure cooker was (and is) a revolutionary cooking appliance, mainly because it eliminates the technicality and potential safety hazards of using a traditional pressure cooker. This appliance is ideal for a giftee who loves making foods that usually take hours to prepare and make tender (think beef stew, chili, pot roast, brisket) but doesn’t have the time to make them on a weeknight. It makes meals 70% faster, according to the brand. Plus, the easy-release steam lid on top makes it safe to use and open once food is done cooking. I tested and wrote areview of the Beast blendera while ago and I still love how powerfully it blends different types of fruit and ingredients such as Greek yogurt. I also appreciate how stylish it is, especially compared to similar blenders on the market. It comes with both a large and small blending bottle, both of which you can add a lid to to take with you. It also comes with a portable monochromatic bottle that has a straw lid, that’s perfect for your giftee to take with them to the gym or work in the morning. While Yeti is known for having some of the best insulated water bottles, they also make other great kitchen appliances, such as thisYeti French Press, which I tested and wrote a review about. It’s easy to use with any type of coffee, it doesn’t stain easily or take a long time to clean, and I love how it keeps coffee hot a long time after brewing. You can also get it in a couple different sizes and take it with you on outdoor adventures or outdoor sports games. This skillet was one of the first pans I had when I moved to New York City, and it lasted me years afterwards, even after I cooked just about anything in it. Whether it was a seared steak, burgers or chicken cutlets, this skillet cooked them perfectly and didn’t get damaged in the process. Since it’s stainless steel, it’s ideal for a giftee who loves crispy or crunchy foods. While it isn’t nonstick you can easily wash it with soap and water. If you have a giftee in mind who is a major pizza fan and loves to cook, this Ooni Pizza oven is the ideal investment. The oven makes it easy for your giftee to make perfectly crispy, pizzeria-level pies at home quickly. Your giftee can choose wood and or charcoal to heat the oven, and they can also cook things like bread, meat and vegetables, according to the brand. I recommend gifting a Butcher Box subscription box to anyone who loves great quality meat, especially steak. I once received a box as a gift, and it was filled with copious amounts of steaks and ground beef that I used to make some of my favorite meals. I love that you can customize the box, based on what your giftee prefers, and the meat comes frozen with ice to make sure it stays fresh for hours, so you don’t have to be home the minute it arrives. The Layers table lamp comes recommended by Alvarez, who loves how decorative it is. “Instead of using overhead lights or bulky lamps to add ambiance and brighten the room, this lamp creates a nice, warm light that also doubles as unique home decor. It is small enough to fit on a media stand or bookshelf,” she says. It’s made of acrylic sheets and a glass orb, which emits a mix of shades for a more dynamic experience. NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson is a seasoned marathon runner, and says that a great recovery slide is an absolute must. She recommends these Ora Recovery slides from Hoka, which she wore for days after running the Chicago Marathon this year. They’re made from breathable EVA material and have ameta-rocker shape, meaning the front end curves upward which makes walking in them more comfortable, according to Hoka. That said, your giftee doesn’t have to be a dedicated runner to enjoy these slides, they’re perfect for simply wearing around the house, too. I previously wrote areview of the Pillow Cubeafter testing it for a month. It’s a great ergonomic pillow that is both soft and resilient. Thanks to its height, it helps prop up the head, which prevents neck pain in the morning. It is also incredibly cooling which as a chronically hot sleeper, I absolutely loved. I didn’t wake up with any sweat around my chest, face or neck after sleeping on it for weeks. We recently tested a few differentwalking shoes from Hoka, and NBC Select associate updates editorZoe Malinand I agreed that the Clifton 9 shoes were the best overall choice. I tested them out and wore them around the office for weeks. They’re incredibly soft on the soles of the feet, and they have medium cushioning. You could use these for everyday walking and tasks or for walking outside before bed or early in the morning. They have a high but flexible pull tab in the back and the brand’s popular meta-rocker shape on the front. The Theragun Mini Massage Gun is a great gift idea for someone who regularly works out and wants to improve their recovery time. The massage gun helps relax muscles after strenuous exercises and relieves pain. It comes with three foam attachments to target different areas around the body and has three speed settings. Plus, it’s only around the size of a small dumbbell, so your giftee can take it with them on trips to the gym. Swanson uses a Theragun to help recover from long runs. NBC Select reporterHarry Rabinowitztested and wrote areview for the Garmin Forerunner, and said that it provided excellent data details and had a great battery life. It’s a perfect fitness tracker for athletes, particularly runners who want to hit a goal, according to Rabinowitz. It has a comfortable wristband, long battery life and it tracks data such as your sleep score, past recovery time and distance. Suri sent me a sample of the Suri Electric Toothbrush to try, and I love how thorough it is on my teeth without irritating my sensitive gums. It has two speed settings, so your giftee can choose the one that’s right for them. With this toothbrush, I don’t feel obligated to harshly press the bristles against my teeth since it’s doing most of the work. It also comes with a magnetic holder that you can stick to the wall in your bathroom, this way your giftee doesn’t have to worry about it fitting in a holder or water getting on it. Rabinowitz also tested outthe Oura Ring3, a popular fitness tracker. After wearing it for months, he found that it’s a great option for people who prefer something smaller and more comfortable than a fitness watch. A new version was recently released, the Oura Ring 4, and it has an improved eight day battery life, thinner design, improved sleep tracking features, water resistance and much more. We previously tested out the Ostrich Pillow, which won anNBC Select Travel Awardfor best travel pillow. If you’re looking for a gift for someone who travels a lot but often has trouble getting sleep on a plane, this pillow is the answer. Senior social media editor Rosalie Sparaco tried out the pillow while traveling and found that it provided great support, and she loved that you can also use it as an eye mask. If your giftee lives in a particularly warm climate or if they’re chronically hot, this portable neck fan is the most thoughtful gift. On a full charge, it has a 3 to 16 hours of runtime, so it’s perfect for walks outside on a warm day or when walking around a crowded theme park for hours. The fan resembles a pair of over-ear headphones andis only 9.5 ounces. Plus, it’s adjustable, so it can fit around different size necks. I’ve always been a proud advocate for anything from Le Labo, particularly the scent Santal 33, which is easily one of the best eau de parfums for men. While there are a lot of colognes that get a lot of hype online, this one is actually worth it. This small travel tube set is the perfect way to test out the sandalwood scent without fully committing. Plus, they’re easy to stow in a carry-on or suitcase when traveling. Since they’re such a common but essential clothing accessory, it sometimes comes as a surprise that finding a good pair of socks that lasts a while is quite a challenge. I have easily over 10 pairs of these crew socks from Uniqlo, which have held up perfectly for years, after tons of wears and washes. I love that they come in a bunch of different shades and that they’re thin enough to wear year round, but sturdy enough to wear with some fall boots. While I usually get accessories, such as small crossbody bags, from Lululemon, I always tell people about this crewneck sweatshirt, which I got on a whim. It has a modern relaxed crop look on the bottom hem, which means it doesn’t bunch up at the bottom and become uncomfortable, similar to traditional hoodies and sweatshirts that have elastic ribbing at the bottom. It’s also incredibly soft and the construction holds up even after washing it a bunch of times. I also love that it comes in a few different muted colors. This backpack from Carhartt is ideal for a giftee who’s looking for a sturdy backpack that’s also spacious. It’s made of water-repellent polyester material, a large main compartment and a pocket that can fit a 15-inch laptop. It also has two side pockets, which your giftee can use to hold a reusable water bottle or other small belongings such as earbuds. If you want to give your giftee a trendy and popular shoe that isn’t that Samba, the Gazelles are the perfect choice. With a 4.6-star average rating from 742 reviews at Adidas, they have a similar look to the Sambas, but their platforms and upper are a different material and style. The Gazelles are a great shoe for everyday activities, with its rubber outsole and its suede and mesh upper. Plus, they’re available in a range of designs, so you can choose the one that best suits your giftee. Bowman owns these sweatpants from Abercrombie & Fitch, and says they’re some of the best he’s ever tried out. They have an elastic waistband and cuffs at the bottom, making them both comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. They have an ideal loose fit and they’re perfect for wearing to bed or to run errands. “I was pleasantly surprised by these sweats. I’ve had them for about three months now and they still hold up after multiple washes. I also like the design and the soft cotton, which feels great on my skin."" ThePatagonia Black Hole duffel bagwon anNBC Select Travel Award, thanks to its spaciousess and durability. The bag functions as both a duffel bag you’d carry in hand, as well as a backpack, since it has two straps on the top you can wear on your shoulders. It’s available in 44-, 55-, 70- and 100-liter options, though the 44-liter option is the perfect size for taking with you on flights and short trips or even using it as a gym bag. I got this popular suitcase from Away as a Christmas gift last year, and I love how spacious it is, while also being the perfect size for a carry-on. It has a minimalist look and a locking zipper that’s TSA-compliant. The wheels also roll incredibly smoothly on different surfaces, so I can move it around with either two wheels, or let it stand up and roll it with four. Plus, its size is compatible with multiple packing cubes, which the brand also sells. As a commerce editor, I regularly cover sales at REI, which is a mainstay for outdoor and fitness items. If your giftee enjoys running, camping, cycling or other outdoor activities, they’ll surely get a lot of use out of this gift card. The brand sells everything from fitness trackers to tents and sleeping pads to comfortable socks and boots that you can wear outdoors. This simple but durable white t-shirt from Buck Mason is a favorite of Bowman, who says that it’s “heavyweight feel and cropped boxy design is great for casual wear or you can just wear it indoors during colder months of the year.” A bestseller at Buck Mason, the shirt is made from 310GSM(grams per square meter) jersey cotton and has a classic fit that isn’t too tight or oversized, according to the brand. Your giftee can wear it as is, or with a button-down shirt over it for a more upscale look when going out. A good pair of loafers is a staple for any guy, especially since it’s a shoe that can easily pivot between casual and formal. These loafers from Steve Madden have become one of my favorites, since they have a traditional silhouette, but they are paired with a unique white stitching that runs along the upper part of the shoe, which I always get compliments on. They come in three different versions, though I love the monochromatic one since it goes with so many different outfits. I recently upgraded my wallet to this durable one from Carhartt, and I love the look and feel of it — it’s smooth on the outside and easy to take out or put in my pocket. It has a clear panel for my ID, which is both secure and easy to remove when I’m at the airport. It also has plenty of space for my cards and cash. I have the bifold option, but it comes in a couple different styles, so you can choose whichever your recipient prefers.

The best foam rollers for muscle pain relief,"Foam rolling is a treatment that helps speed up recovery from muscle soreness and tightness. It’s also a popular method for self-myofascial release, which is a deep-tissue massage that can help with breaking up myofascial adhesions, or trigger points, saysJohn Gallucci Jr., a physical therapist and CEO of JAG Physical Therapy. “This technique is a cost-effective way to give yourself a deep tissue massage before or after a workout,” he says. You can also use a foam roller torelieve muscle tensionand soreness after hours of sitting during work or stress on the job. To help you determine the best foam roller for your needs, I spoke with personal trainers, physical therapists and chiropractors about how to safely use and shop for one, and highlighted their personal recommendations. SKIP AHEADHow I picked the best foam rollers|The best foam rollers to shop|Why trust NBC Select? Foam rollers come in various sizes and densities, so choosing one that’s right for you is crucial to safe and effective sessions. Want more from NBC Select?Sign upfor our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter. Below, I compiled expert-recommended foam rollers to consider based on various use cases and experience levels. I also listed foam rollers our NBC Select editors have tried and loved. This won anNBC Select Wellness Awardfor best overall foam roller due to its unique design — the grooves are tough and sturdy, which helps relieve muscle tension and soreness after a workout or sitting for long hours, according to our reviewers. “My boyfriend has sciatica, or nerve pain, and this foam roller did a really good job of helping them stretch out and align their lower back,” says NBC Select editorial assistant Ariadne Night. The roller has a center groove for an even deeper massage that helps properly align your spine and neck and promote better posture while you use it, according to the brand. The Lululemon Double Roller is anotherNBC Select Wellness Award winnerdue to its versatility. There is a smaller roller inside with a deeper ridge design, which our editors love. The exterior roller is best for use on arms and legs, while the interior roller is ideal for back tension, according to the brand. I love using this foam roller when I’m sore from my workouts because the ridges help to ease tension in my legs, back and shoulders. It’s also very lightweight, so I can take it on-the-go when I need it. This foam roller comes recommended byAllen Conrad,a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the owner of Montgomery County Chiropractic Center. “Many foam rollers seem to wear down after using them a few times, but the Luxfit one is more durable for repeated use,” he says, adding that it’s good for large muscle groups like the hamstrings and quadriceps. Its smooth surface also repels liquid for peace of mind while working out, according to the brand. The TriggerPoint GRID roller is a good option for athletes, according to Conrad. It has a hollow center that makes it flexible enough to move with your body and a firm, contoured design that can withstand up to 500 pounds of pressure, according to the brand. (Due to the firmness and ridges on the roller, Conrad doesn’t recommend it for beginners.) If you’re looking for a more intense foam rolling experience, consider this vibrating foam roller from Hyperice. It has a similar rounded, contoured design as other foam rollers on this list, but comes with three speeds of high-intensity vibrations to massage away tension and loosen up muscles. I use this roller after I do more high-intensity workouts like HIIT to get a better, deeper massage on my legs and arms. (However, keep in mind the vibrations can be very intense, and it’s tough to use the highest speed, in my experience.) You can also pair the roller to the Hyperice app, which provides guided sessions, helps you monitor your progress and more. This Tiger Tail foam roller has non-slip grip handles on either side that can help you guide the roller exactly where you’re targeting and allow it to glide back and forth on the muscle with good stability and pressure, says Conrad. Because of its firmer feel, this roller can soothe tight thighs, hamstrings and quadriceps, as well as pinpoint stubborn sore muscle areas and get rid of chronic muscle tightness, he says. It comes in three sizes: 11 inches, 18 inches and 22 inches. “If you’re looking to add more pressure to the muscles, using a roller with edges and grooves can provide more intensity,” says certified strength and conditioning specialistKristina Jennings. She recommends this one from Rollga, which has multiple grooves to provide a contoured fit to the body and make it easier to target trigger points, according to the brand. It’s also made from professional-grade EPP foam, which can hold more than 2,000 pounds, according to the brand. The Rumble Roller, another recommendation from Jennings, is a firm textured roller with flexible bumps that continuously knead the affected areas of your body, according to the brand. The bumps are less than two inches apart, so you get a good amount of massaging pressure. The foam roller is also water-resistant and repels dirt, according to the brand. If you’re looking for a more affordable foam roller, this one has a flat surface to provide gentle pressure, making it a good place to start for someone new to foam rolling, says Jennings. It comes in sizes ranging from 18 inches up to 36 inches. With the longer length, you can work on larger body areas like the hamstrings and back of both of your legs, says Conrad. Foam rollers have multiple benefits depending on when in your workout you decide to use them, says Gallucci. Prior to a workout, they can break up adhesions, increase circulation and lengthen your muscles, warming them up for activity. After a workout, you can use them as a deep tissue massager. Whether you should use a foam roller before or after your workout depends on your goal, according to Conrad. “If done before an exercise, it will help improve range of motion, elasticity and flexibility. If done after your workout, the main goals are to decrease spasm and delayed onset muscle soreness, which will help you get back to working out faster,” says Conrad. Anyone can benefit from using a foam roller, especially those with soreness, muscle stiffness or fatigue. To properly foam roll, place the sore body part on top of the roller and use your body weight to slowly roll back and forth over the muscle or muscle group, says Gallucci. When using a foam roller, breath through the rolling motion as it hits the affected body parts, says Jennings. You can also use a roller up against the wall to make the motion easier. If you’re new to foam rolling, choose a roller that’s lighter and less intense, says Jennings. Gallucci suggests taking breaks between sessions and gradually increasing the intensity and duration to avoid post-session pain or bruising. “Remember, foam rolling can be uncomfortable, but [it] should never be extremely painful,” he says. If you have a more serious injury, such as a muscle tear or fracture, avoid foam rolling since it can make pain worse, experts say. You should also avoid foam rolling over bony areas; bones are often mistaken for muscle adhesions, and continuously rolling over them can cause pain and inflammation, says Gallucci. You should also avoid rolling the lower back, neck and joints since hyperextension of these areas can cause further injury and inflammation to the tendons and ligaments, he says. If you’re unsure about whether a foam roller is right for you, you should consult your physical therapist, certified athletic trainer or physician.

'We didn't know she was dead',"Survivors were stunned and heartbroken after learning from reporters that a Texas medical school had dissected and studied their relatives’ bodies without consent. This article is part of“Dealing the Dead,”a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research. Some knew their loved one had died, but not what had been done with the body. Others spent years searching, only to discover that their relatives had spent their final hours alone, with no family called to their side. Nearly all said they would have honored the dead with funerals, if only they had known. Instead, these mothers, fathers, sons and daughters were outraged to learn weeks, months or even years later that their relatives’ bodies had been given to a Texas medical school to be studied and dissected, NBC News found ina yearlong investigation. Some of the corpses were injected with preservatives and assigned to medical students. Others were frozen and cut up, their torsos, skull bones, legs and arms leased out to for-profit companies and the military. No one had consented to this treatment. Nearly a dozen of these families received the grim and grisly truth not from a medical examiner, hospital or police officer — but from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo, including six who found their relative’s name on a list of unclaimed bodiespublished by the news outlets in October. “We didn’t know she was dead or what happened to her,” said Abigail Willson, whose mother died at a Fort Worth hospice last year, and then was given without her consent to the Fort Worth-based University of North Texas Health Science Center. “We have searched everywhere, all over Texas. If you wouldn’t have put out that list of names, we never would have known.” Last year, NBC News revealed in its“Lost Rites” seriesthat coroners and medical examiners across the country had repeatedly failed to notify families of their loved ones’ deaths before burying them in paupers’ graves. That investigation led reporters to North Texas, where officials had come to treat the unclaimed dead not as an expensive burden but as a free resource. Since 2019, Dallas and Tarrant counties had sent about 2,350 unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center and, of them, more than 830 were selected for dissection and study. The center advertised these human specimens as being of “the highest quality found anywhere in the U.S,” helping bring in about $2.5 million a year in the process. Heads went for $649. A pair of feet brought in $330. The fee for a whole body: $1,400. The center suspended its body donation program in response toNBC News’ investigation, fired the officials who led it and announced that it would stop using unclaimed bodies. In statements to reporters, the Health Science Center has offered condolences to families affected by what the center called failures of management, care and professionalism. The families who learned from NBC News that their relatives were studied without consent are continuing to mourn their lost loved ones. The dead included military veterans and blue-collar workers. Men and women who struggled with drug addiction and mental illness. A World War II history buff. A young murder victim. These are some of their stories. On the rare occasion he allowed someone to get close to him, Dale Leggett was known for his warm demeanor and dry sense of humor. He enjoyed discussing World War II history and Marvel comic books. He also was extremely private and avoided most social gatherings, his family said. He did little besides go to work day after day, operating a forklift at the same Fort Worth warehouse for four decades. His two siblings tended to see him only once or twice a year, but they loved him dearly. Neither of them were contacted when Leggett died of respiratory failure at the age of 71 in a Fort Worth hospital in May 2023. His younger brother, Tim Leggett, was stunned when he spotted his sibling's name on the list on NBCNews.com. Finding out that way, he said, was “horrendous and tragic.” In the months since, he has worked to piece together what happened. After speaking with an NBC News reporter, Leggett reached out to the Health Science Center for answers. Officials gave him a letter indicating his brother’s body was used to train anesthesiologists — omitting that the training was held in Kentucky by a for-profit medical education company, details that were spelled out in documents obtained by reporters through public records requests. An official at the center also handed Leggett a box containing his brother’s remains. The letter thanked him for his brother’s sacrifice: “We now return him to you with humble gratitude and appreciation.” Leggett took the remains to Oklahoma last month and spread them on their grandparents’ graves. He was glad to finally give his brother a dignified tribute, he said, but he can’t shake the sense that his last wishes had been violated. One reason Dale was so private: He had a deep mistrust of the government and the health care industry. “That’s just one more reason why I believe he never would have agreed to or wanted anything done with his body,” Leggett said. When she was healthy, Nika Hodges loved to write poetry and sing. She was fascinated by astronomy, often gazing up at the stars in wonder. But the 54-year-old mother of three also struggled with addiction and severe schizophrenia, leading to fractured relationships and periods of homelessness. Her biggest paranoia, according to her children, was that medical professionals would take her away and conduct experiments on her. “I know 100% for a fact,” said Abigail Willson, her daughter, “she would not have wanted what happened to her.” Family members had been searching for Hodges since 2021, after she stopped returning messages and disappeared from her apartment. They redoubled their efforts this summer, after the death of Hodges’ father, a longtime police officer in Tarrant County. The private investigator they hired contacted hospitals and homeless shelters before eventually finding her on the list published by NBC News. Willson and her siblings have struggled to determine how this could have occurred. All they know for certain is that Hodges died at a Fort Worth hospice in May 2023 before being declared unclaimed and donated to the Health Science Center. The family went to the center in November to demand answers. They left with a box containing Hodges’ remains and a letter indicating her body had been used to train first-year medical students. “UNT Health Science Center and the medical students involved in these types of courses value the selfless sacrifice made by your family,” it read. But there’s no indication in records obtained by NBC News that Hodges’ body was studied by students in Texas. Instead, another medical school, Touro University, paid the center more than $16,000 to have Hodges’ body and five others shipped to its campus in Great Falls, Montana, in August 2023. A Touro spokesperson said the school no longer relies on the Health Science Center for bodies needed for student training. Officials at the Health Science Center didn’t answer questions about failures to fully disclose to families how their relatives’ bodies were used. Willson and her siblings say they have other unanswered questions, including why nobody contacted them when Hodges died. They said they had several family members living in the area who wouldn’t have been difficult to find. “It was really, really heartbreaking to read the words ‘unclaimed body,’” Willson said. “Because she would have been claimed. She had a family.” Fran Moore has fond memories growing up in New Jersey with her father, Carl Yenner. An Army veteran who worked at a junkyard and later as a hospital janitor, Yenner used to toss a football around the backyard with Moore and her brothers and take them on long day trips through the countryside. But the siblings struggled to stay in touch with Yenner as he aged. He moved to Texas years ago and didn’t have internet or phone service at his home in Wichita Falls. Yenner died at a Dallas hospital in May 2021 at age 79, but nobody at the hospital or medical examiner contacted his survivors. His son filed a missing person report in Wichita Falls and the family hired a private investigator to try to locate him. They learned Yenner was dead when an estate lawyer contacted them later in 2021 about selling his home, Moore said. For years, nobody could tell them where his remains had gone — until Moore got a call this year from an NBC News reporter who’d found Yenner’s name in records obtained from the Health Science Center. She was heartbroken and angry to learn her father’s body had been declared unclaimed and taken for research. “They don’t know anything about that person,” Moore said. “For them to just say, ‘Yeah, go ahead and do this,’ it’s just wrong.” Yenner was one of at least 32 unclaimed military veterans whose bodies were given to the Health Science Center, records show, although the true figure is likely much larger. After the center was finished with his body, his remains were cremated andinterred at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery. Moore said she’s glad Yenner’s military service was honored in the end, but she would have preferred to bury him alongside family in New Jersey — yet another choice that was taken from her. Aurimar Iturriago Villegashad just turned 21 when she arrived in the United States in September 2022 with dreams of finding work and sending money home to her mother in Venezuela. But within two months, she was dead — killed in a road rage shooting outside Dallas. Afterward, her body was delivered to the Health Science Center, where it was cut up and used for medical training. Arelis Coromoto Villegas didn’t learn what was done to her daughter’s body until two years later, when her son saw Aurimar’s name ona Noticias Telemundo social media postabout NBC News’ list of unclaimed bodies. Authorities in Texas had Coromoto Villegas’ phone number, documents show, but there’s no evidence they attempted to call it before declaring her daughter’s body unclaimed and donating it to science. Coromoto Villegas doesn’t have much. She lives in a cinder-block home in a small town in western Venezuela, where electricity is spotty and resources are scarce. But if someone had called her with instructions for how to repatriate her daughter’s body, she says she would have done anything to pay the bill. “I would have done the impossible,” she said in Spanish. “Even sweeping the streets.” After the Health Science Center used it, Aurimar’s body was cremated and her ashes buried in an unmarked plot in a cemetery in Dallas. After learning some of these details from reporters, her mother sought to have the ashes returned to her, but she was rebuffed by local authorities. The struggle to bring her daughter’s body home has taken a toll on Coromoto Villegas’ health. “Sometimes I say, ‘I wish God would have taken me and not her,’” she said. In the absence of a gravesite that she can visit, she has assembled an altar to her daughter in her house. The memorial includes photos, candles and a handwritten prayer, one with a particular meaning for devout Catholics. It’s meant to be a blessing for poor souls — those far from God, longing to come home.

An NFL revival,"Peter Rosenberg had a major scheduling conflict last Sunday. With his first child due next month, he and his wife, Natalie, organized a baby shower to celebrate. Unfortunately, it was during the Washington Commanders game. Rosenberg, who grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is a lifelong fan. He never misses a game and is particularly invested now that the team — after nearly three decades of poor performances on the field and multiple scandals off it — is good again. “I’ve wanted to have kids for a long time, so this is very, very exciting. This is a really, really big deal,” Rosenberg, a 45-year-old radio and TV host, said in an interview. “But I cannot emphasize enough how big of a deal it is in my life that this team doesn’t bring me misery.” With the Commanders vying for a postseason spot, every game is big. They were supposed to cruise against a hapless New Orleans Saints team that was starting a backup quarterback. Except late in the fourth quarter, Washington allowed a 17-point lead to diminish to one point. “The party is really getting going,” said Rosenberg, who watched on an iPad. “I’m trying to be present and I’m trying to be a part of it, but all of a sudden they give up a field goal and then another field goal and then the touchdown.” When the Commanders did not allow the Saints to complete a two-point conversion, winning the game, he finally felt comfortable returning to the event. “I threw my arms up in the air,” he said. “I walked around the room and greeted everyone officially, appropriately and happily. Natalie and I hugged and celebrated for a moment, and then I was able to fully enjoy our baby shower.” What Rosenberg experienced — joy in a team that has mostly provided him anything but that — is a shared sentiment across the fan base. A once-proud franchise with three Super Bowl wins with three different starting quarterbacks in 1982, 1987 and 1991 fell into the depths of despair after much-maligned owner Dan Snyder bought it in 1999. However, since he sold the Commanders in April 2023, there has been a renewed sense of hope. Washington, at 9-5, is off to its best start since 1992. It has not won a playoff game since 2005, meaning an entire generation of fans has not experienced what it’s like to root for a winning organization. Times are changing. When Jeffrey Wright was 6 years old, he won a raffle at Hecht’s department store to be the “Mascot of the Week” for that Sunday’s game. The team fitted him out with a full uniform and let him run out onto the RFK Stadium field before the matchup. He then sat in the end zone and “watched [them] kick the teeth out of the Dallas Cowboys.” Wright, an actor who is now 59, smiles thinking back to that afternoon. He has gone on to win Emmy, Golden Globe and Tony awards, yet memories of attending games with his mother — who had season tickets beginning in 1970 — hold just as much significance in shaping who he is today. But the team Wright grew to love as a kid changed completely when Snyder took over in 1999. A franchise once thought of as a pillar of the league has spent much of the last 25 years consistently losing on the field and embroiled in negativity off it. Under Snyder, there were more names (three) than playoff victories (two). So you can imagine why Wright was fine letting go of his mother’s seats when she died in 2019. “It obviously wasn’t the happiest thing to do. But it wasn’t so difficult,” he said in an interview. “The franchise had been destroyed. The experience had been destroyed. I felt that something had been carved out of the heart of my childhood. I just felt, like a lot of us did, kind of abused by the relationship to the team. You just had to cut loose.” It was a notion shared by much of the fan base. In 24 seasons under Snyder, the team had just six playoff appearances, four NFC East titles and three double-digit winning seasons. He had 27 different starting quarterbacks and 10 head coaches. The team’s .427 winning percentage ranked 27th in the NFL from 1999 to 2022. On top of the poor product on the field, Snyder found himself surrounded by negativity off it. The team was widely criticized for how it was run from the top down. In both 2021 and 2023, the NFL fined it$10 millionand$60 million, respectively, after investigations of allegations of sexual harassment and workplace conduct. Snyder also faced backlash for the way he treated fans, including charging to attend training camp —the first time that had occurred in NFL history— and suing people who tried to back out of ticket renewal plans. One of those fans, a 72-year-old grandmother, had had season tickets since the early 1960s. The team’s name was also a hot-button topic. Snyder vowed publicly to “never change the name” from “Redskins” even though it had long been condemned as an anti-Indigenous slur. But in 2020, after years of pressure from the NFL, major sponsors and groups like the National Congress of American Indians,the franchise moved on. While not all fans were happy with the decision, those who opposed the name felt they finally could root for a franchise without feeling in the wrong. “We were not only the laughingstock of the NFL, we were morally corrupt,” said Eddie Huang, a writer, director and chef. “I had Redskins stuff; we all did. But when you get older, you’re just like: ‘Whoa, this is terrible. Dan Snyder is terrible. The name is bad. There’s a lot of bad stuff going on.’” Asked to sum up Snyder’s tenure in one word, Wright said, “Misery.” Grant Paulsen, a local radio host at 106.7 The Fan, has been covering the team since 1999. He began as a beat reporter with the station and four years later transitioned to be a midday host. With countless fans calling in each day, nobody else knows the pulse of the community like he does. He said Snyder was so unlikable that people refused to buy team merchandise and stopped attending games simply because it felt wrong to support him. In Snyder’s final season in charge, a franchise that onceled the league in average attendanceranked dead last. “To me, if the fandom of his team was a block of ice, he was taking a chisel and just swinging it,” Paulsen said. “Little by little, just chipping away and chipping away until it was all gone.” For a while, it appeared there was no chance Snyder, 60, would sell. When he agreed to sell the franchise for more than $6 billion to a group led by Josh Harris in May 2023, the decision sent shock waves through the fan base. Harris’ group, which included NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, brought on advisers like former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers to assist in a search for a new general manager and head coach. They landed Adam Peters, previously the assistant general manager of the San Francisco 49ers, and former Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn. But the biggest move came in the 2024 NFL draft. The Commanders selected LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels, the winner of the Heisman Trophy, at No. 2 overall to be the savior of the franchise. So far, he has lived up to the hype. Daniels has thrown for 3,045 yards, 17 touchdowns and only six interceptions through 14 games. He has also run for 656 yards (46.9 per game), the second most in the league behind reigning MVP Lamar Jackson. “He’s the quarterback we’ve deserved for suffering all these years,” Huang said. “He’s the guy. I absolutely think this kid is the face of the NFL for the next 15 years.” Nothing encapsulated that feeling more than Daniels’ Hail Mary touchdown pass in the final seconds against the Chicago Bears in October. Trailing 15-12 with six seconds remaining, Daniels avoided multiple defenders and launched a 52-yard bomb toward the end zone. The ball tipped off multiple players and landed in the hands of receiver Noah Brownfor the game-winner. More than 65,000 fans at Northwest Stadium in the Maryland suburb of Landover lost their minds, including Wright, who was filming Showtime’s “The Agency” in London. He said he immediately left for Washington Dulles International Airport from the game and, despite the jet lag, “could have stayed up for three days after that flight.” “There hasn’t been a moment like that in a stadium in D.C. in decades,” he said. “I was just so pumped. That was an absolute jet lag cure. That was a memorable, memorable night in the story of this franchise. It was just a stamp on the beginning of a new era.” Greg Rosenstein is the sports editor for NBC News Digital."
Undocumented and afraid,"LOS ANGELES — Kevin Yang, a 46-year-old undocumented immigrant from China, said he once felt a sense of indebtedness toward the United States. But now, with President-elect Donald Trump’s second term on the horizon, he feels worried and on edge. “The gratitude I once felt toward the U.S for accepting me into the country … has now shifted to anxiety and fear, Yang said. “And I know others in my situation feel the same.” With the incoming Trump administration looking toprioritize deporting Chinese nationals, citing national security concerns, many undocumented Chinese men say they couldn’t feel further afield from the reasoning behind the potential policy — that Trump thinks they’re assembling an army within the United States. Several Chinese undocumented migrants who made the trek across the southern border to the United States spoke about Trump’s mass deportation plans. Sources close to the Trump campaign hadexclusively toldNBC News that undocumented Chinese immigrants who are deemed to be of military age will be among the first groups targeted. But, having fled their homeland because of political persecution, or uprooted their lives for better economic opportunities, many undocumented Chinese men reject the notion of being a threat to the United States as absurd. “We’re not military spies. Do you see anyone buying heavy weaponry or weapons here?” Yang said. “The fact that Trump says this is completely crazy.” Trump’s transition team did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. If indeed focused on immigrants of Chinese descent, Trump’s deportation policies are likely to be challenged legally as a blatant example of racial profiling. But experts note that, after having attempted versions of these policies in his first term, and emboldened by growing support among the public, Trump could be more successful implementing them this time around. “I expect that we will see ICE raids that are carried out for the purpose of terrorizing immigrant communities and where the purpose is inflicting cruelty on immigrants,” Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told NBC News. While Asian immigrants have long been the fastest-growing undocumented population, the number ofChinese nationals crossing into the United Statesin particular has skyrocketed in recent years. Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, the number of undocumented Chinese nationals crossing both the northern and southern borders has tripled, from just over 27,000 to more than 78,000. Experts and undocumented immigrants have said that China’s economic downturn and political friction, which came to a head during the country’s prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions, were largely the basis of the migration wave. But Trump has repeatedly suggested that “military-age” men are conspiring to build an army. “They’re coming in from China — 31, 32,000 over the last few months — and they’re all military age and they mostly are men,” Trump said in April during a campaign rally. “And it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a little army in our country? Is that what they’re trying to do?” And on a Dr. Phil podcast episode released in early December, Trump’s incoming “border czar” doubled down on such comments. “Sixty thousand Chinese males, mostly military age, do not leave China without the coordination and approval of the Chinese government,” said Tom Homan, who was the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term in office. “This is a coordinated national security vulnerability that the Chinese government is involved in.” Bin Wei, a 50-year-old who immigrated with his teenage son, came to the United States by way of the Darien Gap, a land bridge filled with dense jungle connecting Central and South America. He said that immigrants like himself only make the dangerous trek so that they can establish more stability for their families — “not for any kind of military or violent reasons.” “We left a hard and oppressed life — harder than many people in the U.S. can imagine,” Wei said of being painted as an adversary. “All we want is freedom to make life better for us and our kids.” With Trump’s campaign promises casting uncertainty over his future, Wei said he’s been acting in accordance with the Chinese motto, “follow the correct and law-abiding path.” And he’s also been recommended to remain in California, a sanctuary state in which no state and local resources can be used to aid federal immigration enforcement. “Chinese language media is telling us all to watch ourselves, to do everything by the book and the law, because Trump will find any excuse to deport us,” he said. But Wei, who currently lives in Southern California, said he’s most worried about his son. Trump’s policies, Wei worries, could have long-term, far-reaching effects on the teen’s life. “He’s the entire reason why we came to the U.S.,” Wei said. “To think about any kind of diminishing future for him makes me really sad and angry.” Yang, who made the journey across the border in 2022, said he was a city representative back in China and fled after clashes with the Chinese government led to his political persecution. He said he traveled into the United States by foot through a remote, barren area of the desert, weathering severe dehydration before being picked up by Border Patrol agents. Trump’s election has left him “deeply saddened and helpless,” he said. Yang said much of the president-elect’s campaign promises smack of the political leadership that he fled from. “Their proposed policies such as establishing large-scale detention camps for illegal immigrants and deploying the military to deport immigrants is disturbingly similar to the methods used by dictators like Xi Jinping,” Yang said. Yang added that the “disregard for any kind of laws or regulations” from the Trump administration also feels similar to the authoritarian regime in China. Trump’s targeting of Chinese immigrants is likely to face legal pushback, including accusations of racial profiling, especially if Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids ramp up as they did in his first term, Mukherjee told NBC News. “Simply from looking at a person, it is impossible to know if they are a U.S. citizen or not,” said Mukherjee, the clinic director at Columbia Law School. “As ICE agents carry out raids, they will sweep a large number of people into their drag net, including those with lawful status in the United States.” Early in his first term, Trump escalated the number of workplace raids, targeting a string ofAsian restaurants in central Mississippi, for example, among many other sites. This time around, Trump has been looking to broaden the types of places ICE agents can sweep, with several sourcesexclusively telling NBC Newsthat he intends to rescind a policy that prevents these agents from arresting immigrants in houses of worship and schools among other “sensitive” areas without approval from supervisors. “I don’t say this to be alarmist,” Mukherjee said, urging undocumented immigrants to apply for immigration relief and learn their rights. “I just think that people need to be prepared.” Mukherjee said that people should take precautions to avoid arrest and detention, including refusing to open the door to any strangers unless they show a judicial search warrant. And if an immigration officer or law enforcement approaches them in a public location, she said, undocumented immigrants still have the right to remain silent. “You don’t need to say where you were born. You don’t need to answer when you entered the country. You should try to stay calm,” she said. “You shouldn’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first and reviewing the paperwork with a lawyer.” Los Angeles-based attorney Frank Hwu, who’s represented thousands of Chinese undocumented immigrants, also noted that while Chinese undocumented immigrants who have immigration relief secured or pending are unable to be deported without their day in court, they can still be detained. And this has made some of his clients now fearful of checking in with ICE, an otherwise routine, regular appointment that most have complied with since entering the United States. “You don’t want to be detained while you’re waiting for court, because the court process takes years,” Hwu said, adding that he had a client who was detained for six months. “They’re here with their children, with their moms and grandmas.” The potential of being repatriated has left many undocumented immigrants anxious about returning to China. Hwu said many of his clients aren’t fearful of going back to difficult life conditions as much as they are of the unknown consequences of their illegal immigration. On most days, Wei says he doesn’t even allow his mind to go there. “Speaking for myself, I am very afraid of going back to China,” Wei said. “There is no doubt that the government will not be happy with me, and that I will be punished severely.” China has not been so open to accepting repatriated immigrants in the past. But the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement to NBC News that the country will be cooperating with efforts to repatriate undocumented immigrants, accepting repatriated individuals who are confirmed to be Chinese citizens through their verification process. “As a matter of principle, the Chinese government firmly opposes all forms of illegal immigration and has engaged in practical cooperation with immigration enforcement agencies of relevant countries, including the United States, achieving positive results,” the country’s foreign ministry said. And in December, the Department of Homeland Security conducted its fourth large charter removal flight in less than six months to China. Along with prioritizing the deportation of military-age Chinese immigrants, Trump has promised toend birthright citizenship, stripping rights from those born in the country to undocumented parents. The Trump transition team is also compiling a list of countries, including Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas, to which it may deport migrants whose home countries refuse to accept them. Ultimately, Yang said, Trump has gotten it all wrong. “The Chinese people that I encountered crossing illegally into the United States have a simple purpose: To find a place where they can survive,” Yang said.

Congress avoids a shutdown but leaves 'a big mess' for Trump and the GOP in 2025,"WASHINGTON — Congress struck an eleventh-hour deal toavert a government shutdown during the holidays, but in the process, it lengthened an already extensive to-do list for the first year of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office. The funding bill keeps the government open until March 14. Even though Republicans will control the White House, the House and the Senate, they’ll again need Democratic votes to stop a shutdown in less than three months. In addition, Trump’s demand that Congress extend or abolish the debt ceiling to take it off his plate next year failed dramatically. On Wednesday, he threatened electoral primary challenges against “any Republican” who voted to fund the government without dealing with the debt limit. On Friday, 170 House Republicans defied him and did just that. The turmoil of the week previews the legislative chaos that awaits Washington in the second Trump administration as the incoming president faces a wide range of major deadlines and ambitions. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Republicans made a mistake by punting funding to March 14, and instead should have approved a stopgap bill through the end of next September to clear their plate for Trump’s agenda. “I think it’s kind of stupid,” he said of the new deadline. “Don’t ask me to explain or defend this dysfunction.” Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., said late Friday that the “lesson” of the last few days is: “Unity is our strength. Disunity is the enemy of the conservative cause.” He advised Trump and his team to avoid such a situation in the future by presenting legislative demands “early” so the GOP can “air out whatever differences there are” well before a deadline. “The House needs to overcommunicate within our various factions,” Barr said. “The House needs to overcommunicate with [incoming Senate] Majority Leader [John] Thune, and House and the Senate both need to overcommunicate with the administration.” In the last four days, the communication was particularly poor. A day after Speaker Mike Johnson released an initial bipartisan deal,Trump and his billionaire confidant Elon Musk blew it up. The speaker went through three additional iterations of his plan to prevent a shutdown, ultimately succeeding after nixing Trump’s most consequential — and last-minute — demand. “I’m concerned,” said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who faces re-election in 2026. “Obviously, we’ve seen this kind of chaos for the last two years. So I would fully expect we’ll see that continue in the next two years and probably get even worse.” On Thursday night, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., downplayed what he called a “disjointed process,” saying it’s a natural way for House Republicans and Trump’s team to understand “how to communicate with each other.” “It’s going to be awesome. You know why it’s going to be awesome? Because now we know how to work together,” Van Orden said just before the speaker’s Plan B went down in flames in the House. Van Orden’s fellow Wisconsinite, Sen. Johnson, was less bullish about smoothly plowing through the early part of the 2025 agenda. “We got a big mess on our hands, no doubt about it,” Johnson said. “That’s why I’m trying to underpromise and hopefully overdeliver.” In addition to another government funding deadline and a debt limit that must be addressed by mid-2025 to avert a calamitous default, Trump and Republicans need to confirm his personnel through the Senate, and they want to passmajor party-line bills to beef up immigration enforcement and extend his expiring 2017 tax law. “It’s not going to be boring,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, deadpanned when asked about the tasks facing Congress next year. There’s also the question of Musk after his role in scuttling the original bipartisan funding deal raised hackles across Capitol Hill. “A lot of people on both sides of the aisle are deeply disturbed by a billionaire threatening people if they don’t vote the right way,” Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said. The tumult of the last week “foretells something very ominous about next year,” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said after the House vote, noting that the Republican majority in the lower chamber will beeven smaller next year. “I think we’re in for a lot of turbulence on the Republican side of the House because of the instability and chaos and disruption that Trump embraces,” Connolly said. He also wondered whether Republicans will be able to elect a speaker on Jan. 3 with a wafer-thin majority; it took 15 rounds of voting to elect a speaker at the beginning of the last Congress and some hard-right Republicans are wobbly on Mike Johnson after his handling of the shutdown threat this week. “So I leave very unsettled tonight in terms of what we just experienced,” Connolly said before the House adjourned for the holidays. “I think it’s very ominous, and it is portentous.” Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News."
Senate Democrats blast Supreme Court's 'ethical crisis' as investigation concludes,"WASHINGTON — A lengthy investigation by Senate Democrats into alleged ethical lapses by Supreme Court justices has ended with the releaseof a report Saturday criticizing the judiciary and calling for legislative reforms that incoming Republican leadership opposes. Republicans are set to take control of the Senate in January, meaning the report is likely the final word on the issue for a while. “The Supreme Court has mired itself in an ethical crisis of its own making by failing to address justices’ ethical misconduct for decades,” the report says. The 95-page document details the previously reported alleged transgressions, including the undisclosed trips taken by Justice Clarence Thomas with his friend, billionaire Harlan Crow. It was ProPublica’sreportingof the trips starting in April 2023 that triggered the investigation. The renewed attention on the court’s ethics did ultimately lead the justices to adopt a new ethics code in November 2023, but it wasimmediately criticizedfor being insufficient, mostly because it has no enforcement mechanism. In the report, Democrats bemoaned the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts declined to speak to the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. They also called for Congress to pass a law to put in place a more rigorous code that would allow for ethics complaints to be reviewed by an independent panel. This year, the bill was approved by the Judiciary Committee on party lines, butRepublicans blockeda final vote on the Senate floor. “An enforceable code of conduct for the Supreme Court is essential in light of the court’s failure to police itself,” the report says. In other findings, the report found justices are lax in identifying conflicts of interest that should trigger recusal. It also criticizes Thomas for failing to recuse from cases concerning the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters because of the role of his wife, Ginni Thomas, in supporting then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The report takes aim at the judiciary’s administrative arm too, saying that the Judicial Conference has “failed to enforce financial disclosure regulations.” Mark Paoletta, a conservative ally of Thomas, pushed back at the investigation of the justices in alengthy post on Xahead of the report’s release. “This entire investigation was never about ‘ethics’ but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court because the Court is no longer acting like a super legislature handing down opinions implementing the Democrats’ political agenda,” he wrote.

Kash Patel’s potential targets fear his tenure as FBI director,"The first signs of alarm came hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced what could prove to be one of his most consequential Cabinet picks. Less than a day after Trump named Kash Patel as his choice for FBI director, a former federal law enforcement official asked me a question: ""curious if I'm on that list?"" He was referring to a list of roughly 60 people who Patel had said were members of the “deep state” in a memoir last year, “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for Our Democracy."" Days later, a former intelligence official reached out to ask the same question. After checking the book, I told them they hadn’t made the list. But even for those not on the list, their absence hasn’t quelled alarm at a potential Patel tenure as FBI director. A dozen current and former Justice Department, FBI and intelligence officials expressed fears to NBC News that Patel, if confirmed, would use his power as FBI director to criminally investigate Trump’s perceived adversaries, including them. The choice of Patel, who has used claims of “deep state” conspiracies against Trump to fuel his rise in Trumpworld and apparently gain the president-elect’s trust, signaled to current and former officials, as well as many observers, that Trump’s campaign trail talk about seeking vengeance was more than just that. On Wednesday, those fears deepened when the head of a Republican-controlled House subcommitteeformally requested that the FBI criminally investigateformer Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for her work on the House committee that investigated Trump’s actions before and during the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. capitol. The announcement came ten days after Trump saidin an interview with NBC Newsthat members of the Jan. 6 committee were “political thugs and, you know, creeps,” and that, “for what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.” Cheney dismissed the calls for her to be criminally investigated in apost on Bluesky. She said Trump and his allies were fabricating ""lies and defamatory allegations in an attempt to cover up what Donald Trump did... No reputable lawyer, legislator or judge would take this seriously.” Patel, a 44-year-old lawyer who grew up on Long Island, has worked as a federal public defender in Florida, a Justice Department prosecutor and a congressional staffer. While he was working for former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Patel’s standing with Trump and Trump loyalists soared after he wrote a memo accusing FBI officials of political bias and abuse of power during their investigation of possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. The memo accurately described what were later found to have been abuses by the FBI relating to surveillance of Trump aide Carter Page. But the DOJ inspector general uncovered no evidence of political bias driving the FBI's Russia investigation. Patel then worked in the White House as a senior director for counter-terrorism before briefly serving in the Pentagon as the Defense Secretary's chief of staff. Critics say that Patel does not have managerial experience to run the FBI and that his rise has been primarily fueled by his willingness to spread unproven conspiracy theories that paint Trump as the victim of plots engineered by Democrats. But Patel has so farreceived strong support from Republican senatorsin his bid to direct the FBI. If he gets the job, Patel has made no secret of what his priorities might be, and who could face investigation. In ""Government Gangsters,"" he describes the “Deep State” as a corrupt cabal of Republican and Democrats, elected officials and civil servants, and senior FBI, DOJ and Pentagon officials who he says have committed crimes against Trump. “The Deep state is continuing to weaponize the power of the state against internal dissidents,” Patel wrote. “They are the ones who covered up their own crimes. … They are the criminals.” Patel’s list of Deep State members ranges from top Trump political adversaries, such as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, to lifelong Republicans who served in Trump’s first administration but declined to support his false claims that he won the 2020 election, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former national security adviser John Bolton. His definition of the 'deep state' appears to include the organization he hopes to lead. “One of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State is the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” he wrote. “The FBI is now the prime functionary of the Deep State.” The dozen current and former officials who have spoken to NBC News said that the various federal investigations of Trump were fueled by his statements or actions and that they were all conducted properly. They said they do not fear going to jail because they committed no crimes. Echoing legal experts, they said they expected federal judges, who are lifetime appointees, to throw out meritless charges filed against them. They said they expected juries to throw them out as well — though they do worry about the impact protracted federal investigations could have on their lives and finances. They contend that Patel is simply accusing anyone who declines to carry out Trump’s wishes, Republican or Democrat, of being corrupt or committing crimes. And some have noted that, by having written this book, Patel has likely made it much easier for anyone on his list to have a case against them dismissed on grounds of vindictive prosecution. Patel and other pro-Trump Republicans say that Democrats, along with DOJ and FBI officials, have weaponized law enforcement agencies against Trump. They say the criminal investigations into whether Trump cooperated with Russia and paid hush money during the 2016 election, tried to reverse the results of the 2020 election and declined to return classified documents after leaving office were all meritless. Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, said that Patel would end politically motivated criminal investigations, not launch them. “Kash Patel is going to end the weaponization of law enforcement,” Pfeiffer said. “The FBI will target crime, not individuals with Kash leading the bureau.” He added: “Kash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director.” Democrats have said that claims that the Justice Department and FBI during the Biden administration have been politically biased are false, citing recent prosecutions of some prominent Democrats, as well as Biden’s son Hunter. “This Department of Justice has brought charges against a Democratic U.S. senator in New Jersey, a Democratic congressman in Texas,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee, said in aCNN interviewearlier this month, referring to Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. “I mean, the deep state, nobody’s ever defined it,” Raskin added. “Apparently, it just means anybody who doesn’t do the will of Donald Trump.” In interviews with NBC News, multiple people whom Patel declared members of the “deep state” expressed alarm at being publicly labeled as possible criminals by a potential FBI director. All of them said they were not part of the “deep state” and were not part of any secret effort to undermine Trump or any other president. The former federal law enforcement official who first asked about Patel’s list urged senators to not confirm Patel as FBI director, citing fear that Patel would use the bureau for intimidation and retribution, as longtime bureau director J. Edgar Hoover did. “Kash Patel is a political extremist who has no business coming anywhere near the FBI, let alone serving as its director,” said the former official, who asked not to be named because of concerns about potential retaliation. “Under no circumstances should he be confirmed for such a position.” Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during Trump’s first term and who is on Patel’s list, noted that senior DOJ officials, including the FBI director, are supposed to follow longtime Justice Department procedures that call for the facts and the law to drive criminal investigations, not politics. “When I was deputy attorney general, President Trump regularly expressed his opinion about who should be fired or prosecuted,” Rosenstein said. “I didn’t treat his opinions as orders. Lawyers who take leadership positions at the Department of Justice know they need to base prosecution decisions on the facts and the law.” In addition to his memoir, Patel has written three children’s books in which he appears to portray himself as a truth-seeking wizard — “Kash the Distinguished Discoverer” — who uncovers plots against a character named “King Donald,” who appears to be Trump. The characters plotting against King Donald are “Hillary Queenton,” “Baron Von Biden,” “Comma-la-la” and “the Shifty Knight,” apparent references to Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Adam Schiff. In Patel’s third children’s book, “The Plot Against the King 3: The Return of the King,” the Dragon of Jalapenos, an apparent reference to the Department of Justice — indeed the dragon is sometimes just referred to as “DOJ” — is deceived by the “Shifty” Knight into believing that Trump is an enemy. The dragon tries to eat King Donald, but the Kash character helps rescue him and the dragon learns he has been lied to. The book ends with King Donald riding the Dragon of Jalapenos, chasing Baron Von Biden and Comma-la-la out of the kingdom as the dragon breathes fire at them. One former FBI official predicted a mass exodus of agents who are eligible for retirement from the bureau if Patel is confirmed. “I have received calls from lifers who are putting in their papers,” said the former FBI official, who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation. “Agents will continue to do their jobs. They will follow the rule of law and the Constitution. It is the circus that they want to avoid.” A staffer on the Jan. 6 committee defended its work but asked not to be named because he feared being investigated by Patel. The staffer said the panel's work was fully legal and “constitutionally protected Congressional activity” but that they wouldn’t be surprised if they were criminally investigated by Patel regardless. They said Patel could ""launch an investigation just to make our lives miserable,” and added that they believe Trump and Patel are trying to send a message: “If you try to hold Trump accountable for his bad behavior, you’re going to face retribution.” The former intelligence official said that some members of the intelligence community are concerned about being investigated by a Patel-run FBI and by the GOP-led Congress. As various individuals are named as potential targets, people are left to wonder, “Where in the hierarchy of retribution are you?” said the former intelligence official. A former DOJ official who worked in the first Trump administration said that Patel and Pam Bondi, Trump’s current choice for attorney general, in the end would be on a mission impossible if confirmed. He said that Trump will make clear what he wants Bondi and Patel to do and then push them out if they don’t do it. “If the Attorney General and the FBI Director seem to resist doing what he makes clear he wants, he will attack them publicly in social media posts and through conservative media pundits, to bring pressure on them,” said the official. “We saw that with Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, and he will do it again. Ultimately, he will fire the Attorney General and the FBI Director or force them out if they don’t do what he wants.” David Rohde is the senior executive editor for national security at NBC News.

Elon Musk's meetings with foreign leaders alongside Trump alarm Washington insiders,"Elon Musk has been a constant companion to President-elect Donald Trump as Trump meets with foreign leaders — anever-present personality at Mar-a-Lagosince November, even accompanying Trump to Paris on his first foreign trip since winning the election. Musk’s proximity to the incoming president has given him invaluable access to heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron at the ceremonial reopening of Notre Dame and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in New York, referring to her as a “precious genius” and “even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside” in introductory remarks at a black-tie gathering. More notably, Musk joined Trump’s pivotal first call after the election with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Musk’s interactions with world leaders alongside Trump are raising questions about the tech leader’s potential influence on U.S. foreign policy over the next four years and the potential for conflicts of interest, Washington insiders say. Musk maintains extensive worldwide investments, especially in China, America’s most powerful adversary, and has openly supported far-right political movements around the world. “It’s on a level that is so foreign to me I can’t get my head around it,” a former national security official in President Barack Obama’s Cabinet said. “Being in these meetings alone or with Trump, who knows what ethics violations are taking place.” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said “Elon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency. The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest.” Musk holds over $15 billion in federal contracts — principally through his SpaceX rocket company that NASA hascome to rely onfor aspects of its rocket program. The Pentagon depends on Musk for SpaceX’s Starlink satellite services, which arecritical for U.S. military operationsaround the world. Behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian PresidentVladimir Putinand Chinese PresidentXi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Since 2014, Trump has traveled to China at least eight times where he had meetings with senior Chinese officials. In one meeting, he was even offered a Chinese green card by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, according tothe Wall Street Journal. Musk met directly with Xi at an exclusive 2023 dinner in San Francisco when he visited the U.S. for a daylong summit in 2023. Musk’s Tesla electric vehicles, which account foralmost 50% of all EV salesin the U.S., are largelymanufactured in China, where the company opened its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla’s largest factories. Asked about Musk’s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: “I’m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it’s Trump.” Especially troubling to some is Musk’s prospective role recommending ambitious cuts in federal jobs. The former intelligence official added, “When he’s one of the arbiters of government efficiency, and how many thousands of people he can fire, he has all these government conflicts.” Musk’s government contracts involve more than 17 U.S. government agencies. This week,The New York Times reportedthat the Pentagon is looking into whether Musk complied with disclosure rules for his top-secret security clearance requiring him to report meetings with foreign officials, citing unnamed sources. “I think he has incredible conflicts,” the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, told NBC News, adding, “His association with the president-elect has already profited him as far as his personal assets are concerned.” When asked if he thinks Musk’s meetings with foreign leaders create problems because of his businesses in China and other countries, Cardin said, “I don’t want a transactional person who’s going into a country to see if he can make a deal.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about Musk’s influence in shaping Trump’s foreign policy, told NBC News: “We have one president at a time. That president is President Biden.” Clearly eager to smooth over any friction in the transition, Blinken quickly added praise for his likely successor, veteran Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, whom Trump has announced as incoming national security adviser. “We’re in close communication with the incoming administration,” Blinken said, adding, “It’s perfectly natural on one level for them to have conversations, communications, and in some ways, it’s helpful to us, because we want to make sure that, as I said, we are handing over the baton in a way that the next administration can come in and be running at full speed.” He did not directly answer the question about Musk’s unofficial role. Musk has previously expressed an interest in affecting the trajectory of foreign affairs, which could further affect his dealings with world leaders. For months, Musk has clashed with British Prime MinisterKeir Starmer, calling Britain a “tyrannical police state,” endorsing calls for a new election and boosting a video from a jailed far-right activist. In August, Musk stoked tensions there by saying the country was on the verge of civil war following days offar-right violence. Musk has supported far-right movements around the world, including in Italy and most recently in Germany, where on Friday he expressed support for the country’s AfD party, saying it could “save Germany.” In the last several days, consternation and excitement around Musk’s potential influence under Trump reached a fever pitch after Musk initiated a movement that quickly torpedoed funding legislation supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. As some Republicans have celebrated Musk’s successful effort to intervene, suggesting he should be made speaker of the House, many critics haveraised concernsthat Musk could be acting as a sort of “shadow president” or “co-president” to Trump.

AI traffic cameras could be watching you on the road,"Police around the world are using artificial intelligence-powered cameras to crack down on behavior like texting behind the wheel and driving without a seat belt. The traffic cameras, which use AI to detect and flag certaindriving behaviors, might make it easier to prosecute more people than ever before for driving infractions. And the use of the cameras is quickly spreading. Acusensus, an Australian company, has worked with governments in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States to roll out some of the AI traffic cameras. Its camera system, called “Heads Up,” uses AI to catch drivers who are texting while driving or aren’t wearing seat belts. The Heads Up cameras take pictures of every vehicle that passes by them, capturing images of their license plates, as well as their front seats. AI analyzes the images and determines how likely it is that a violation occurred, assigning each one a “confidence level.” The cameras have beenwidely tested in the U.K., where nearly half of the country’s police forces have tried them, and in Australia, where they’ve sparked debates about privacy anddrawn media attention. David Kelly, Acusensus’ vice president of government solutions, said that if the software doesn’t detect anything, a picture is deleted. However, if the software does detect a violation, a human officer inspects the image to determine whether it depicts an offense. “If there’s no violation, we’re not saving the data. There’s no data for us to save. And if, when it’s reviewed, if there’s no citation that’s issued, there’s no data that’s saved,” Kelly said. Kelly said that local governments decide what happens to photos of violations and that Acusensus doesn’t keep violations data. Kelly said he wasn’t able to share the total number of cameras that have been set up, saying that “planned maintenance” affects the total and that the company defers “to our clients to release that information if they choose.” A recent news releasefrom Transport for Greater Manchester, where the Heads Up system was going through atwo-month temporary trial, reported that more than 3,200 people were found not wearing their seat belts or texting and driving. In the United States, the cameras function differently from those in the U.K. and Australia. Acusensus has camerasin Georgia and North Carolinathat use its “Heads Up Real Time Solution.” The Heads Up Real Time system in the United States sends images to nearby police officers, allowing them to stop drivers before violations occur. The other Heads Up product used internationally sends the pictures to law enforcement officials as part of an evidence package, and they can mail out tickets to offending drivers. Kelly said an automated ticketing program, such as Heads Up, would require state legislation to authorize its use. Speed and red light cameras are already familiar to U.S. drivers, capturing license plates and sending tickets by mail. With speed cameras, the devices usually use detectors to measure vehicles’ speeds. If a camera detects that a vehicle is speeding, it will take a picture of the license plate and send a citation to the owner through the mail. Red light cameras work similarly, and photos are usually reviewed by law enforcement officers,according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. With AI systems like Acusensus’, police officers are able to find vehicles that have violated the law and stop them in real time and detect more complex behaviors. “With a ticket in the mail, you get it three weeks later, and you’re like, ‘Wait a second. I don’t remember that,’ but in this instance, you’re able to change that behavior immediately,” Kelly said. “When we’re talking with law enforcement, that’s something that they like. They really like the ability to be able to engage with the driver and to make that stop and to change that behavior immediately.” In the United States, Heads Up Real Time targets only commercial vehicles. First Sgt. Christopher Knox of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety said three mobile cameras are set up in the state, usually in areas with high collision rates, such as multilane highways. Since North Carolina began using Heads Up Real Time last year, seat belt violations have risen sixfold and phone violations have increased ninefold,Acusensus said in a news release. Beyond state law enforcement, Acusensus has partnered with multiple U.S. universities to trial the Heads Up cameras, including the University of Alabama and theUniversity of California, San Diego— whose programs are ongoing. With the UC San Diego program, cameras have been set up in the San Diego area, capturing images of commercial truck drivers practicing “unsafe driving practices,” such as speeding, using cellphones and failing to wear seat belts.  On a website describing the program, the university says the technology identifies the behaviors “anonymously.” At the University of Alabama, Kelly said, the studies focus on passenger cars. Kelly also said Acusensus had a brief demonstration of the cameras at Louisiana State University. According to Govspend, a database of government contracts and purchases, there were eight sites set up in Louisiana. Kelly said that no colleges’ programs involve law enforcement and that the programs are focused on collecting data about unsafe driver practices. He added that Acusensus is confirming the violations it has found and is preparing a report for the researchers. He said the company isn’t sharing violation images with UC San Diego or the University of Alabama. Kelly added that for the college programs “all data is deleted at the end of the program” and that no personally identifiable information is collected. Acusensus’ websitesays it has multiple measures to protect the privacy of those captured in the images, including a “secure network architecture that heavily restricts and traces all access” and the blurring of parts of images that will be presented for humans to review. Acusensus also encrypts the images, making them accessible only to the government agencies receiving them. It also said its AI system is trained to learn how to detect violations without storing past images. Acusensus’ privacy policy reiterates that “our access to and use of personal information is fairly minimal and limited to that required for our part of the operation of the overall solution” and that “our solutions operate with privacy protections as agreed with our clients (typically government or enforcement agencies).” However, when it comes to ensuring people’s privacy isn’t violated, Daniel Solove, an intellectual property and technology law professor at George Washington University Law School, is skeptical of Acusensus’ model. “There has to be real oversight to make sure they are doing what they say they’re doing and then oversight to make sure that if they don’t do it, [there is] a penalty for not doing it,” Solove said. “So they say, ‘Oh, yeah, we’ll delete it,’ but will they? I don’t know. I mean, unless there’s accountability, that’s a meaningless statement to me.” In Queensland, Australia, where Heads Up is being used, the government insists that its residents have nothing to worry about when it comes to privacy.On its website, the Queensland government has disclosed that “two privacy impact assessments have been independently undertaken by an external service provider,” and it has made the reports open to the public. Acusensussaid in a news releasethat in a trial in Queensland in 2020, more than 15,000 people were detected using their cellphones and over 2,200 people were detected not wearing seat belts. The Queensland governmentreported that since it set up the cameras, road deaths have gone downby 7.1%. Knox said that in North Carolina, when an image is found to have recorded a violation, it will be kept to be added to an investigative file and that when a case is dismissed, images are disposed of. He said the only people who have access to the images are the prosecutors and the investigating officers. Knox said the images aren’t shared externally in any way but added that he wasn’t sure whether any external agency or organization enforced that provision. “We’ll [sic] admittedly hear some folks raise some privacy concerns, because these cameras are set up at an angle to be able to [look] into the cabin of a truck, but I think folks generally understand and appreciate that distracted driving is an issue,” Ben Greenberg, president of the North Carolina Trucking Association,told Fox News. Jolynn Dellinger, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University School of Law who specializes in privacy law and policy and tech ethics, said there may be a trade-off between privacy and safety when it comes to enforcement systems such as Acusensus’. “As technology becomes more and more powerful, privacy necessarily can shrink in proportion to the power of that technology,” Dellinger said. “It may be a case where, in this case, privacy should be compromised for this greater good, but it’s still important to recognize that it is a privacy interest.” She added that it is important to remember that the technology can provide a more efficient way to enforce the law. In every state except Montana,texting and driving is illegal, and depending on the state, it can even be illegal to simply have your phone in your hand while you’re driving, regardless of whether it’s being used. Failing to wear a seat belt isn’t as heavily punishable, withonly 35 stateshaving laws for seat belts that allow officers to issue tickets solely because of the lack of seat belt use. All states where Acusensus has installed cameras have primary laws for seat belt use. Although the use of seat belts is high,with 91.9% of drivers using them last year, commercial truck drivers are less likely to drive with them on; 14% of commercial motor vehicle drivers say they don’t wear them,according to a 2016 surveyconducted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Texting while driving is a growing concern in the United States. According toa Pew Research study, drivers distracted by their phones while driving was people’s No. 1 concern when it came to road safety, with 78% of people finding it a major issue. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationreported that over 3,000 people diedin vehicle crashes that involved distracted drivers in 2022. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team."
"Party City to close all of its stores, report says","Party City on Friday announced it will close all of its stores and has initiated corporate layoffs effective immediately, according toa CNN report. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to “commence a winddown process immediately,” and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. “That is without question the most difficult message that I’ve ever had to deliver,” Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company’s closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw “many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers,” according toa press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween’scontinued risewithin and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October thatit would open10 new “Spirit Christmas” stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City’s operation, even as the company beganto offer itemsonAmazonin 2018.

"Tesla recalls nearly 700,000 vehicles over tire pressure light issue","Tesla hasissued a recallfor nearly 700,000 vehicles due to a tire pressure light issue. The electric car company is recalling certain 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3 and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles because the tire pressure monitoring system warning light “may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. The NHTSA released its safety recall report Tuesday, noting that “driving with improperly inflated tires increases the risk of a crash.” The recall affects around 694,000 vehicles. Tesla said as a remedy it released an over-the-air software update for free. Owner notification letters are expected be mailed on Feb. 15, 2025. This isn’t the first recall the car manufacturer has faced. Its Cybertruck alone has received seven recalls this year,The Associated Press reported. Last month,a recall on the Cybertruckcentered on ""a fault in the drive inverter,"" which the NHTSA said ""may cause a loss of drive power to the wheels."" That recall involved around 2,400 vehicles. In that case, Tesla said it would replace the drive inverter for free. In July, Tesla issued a recall for more than1.8 million vehiclesafter it received reports that the hoods on some were unintentionally popping open.

Starbucks union announces strike to last through Christmas Eve in 3 major cities,"Love Starbucks holiday drinks? This week, you may not get them. Starbucks Workers United announced baristas will strike starting Friday in three key markets — Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. Theunionsaid the move is in response to the coffee chain's “failure to bring viable economic proposals to the bargaining table” and “to resolve hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practice charges.” The union, which started organizing in 2021, represents 525 union stores and over 10,500 union workers, according to its website. Starbucks has over 10,000 company-operated locations. “Since February, Starbucks has repeatedly pledged publicly that they intended to reach contracts by the end of the year — but they’ve yet to present workers with a serious economic proposal,” the group wrote onX. “This week, less than two weeks before their end-of-year deadline, Starbucks proposed no immediate wage increase for union baristas, and a guarantee of only 1.5% wage increases in future years.” The group said baristas starting Friday morning will embark on five days of escalating strikes that could spread to other cities through Christmas Eve “unless Starbucks honors our commitment to work towards a foundational framework.” Starbucks, which is headquartered in Seattle, told NBC News there has been “no significant impact” to its store operations. ""We are aware of disruption at a small handful of stores, but the overwhelming majority of our US stores remain open and serving customers as normal,” company spokesperson Phil Gee said in a statement. About 10 of its company-operated stores did not open as planned on Friday. In a Tuesdaynews releasethe union said it and Starbucks had announced a path forward earlier this year and have advanced dozens of tentative agreements at the table, but “Starbucks has yet to bring a comprehensive economic package to the bargaining table.” “Starbucks can’t get back on track as a company until it finalizes a fair contract that invests in its workforce. Right now, I’m making $16.50 an hour. Meanwhile, Brian Niccol’s compensation package is worth $57,000 an hour,” Silvia Baldwin, a Philadelphia barista and bargaining delegate, said in a statement referring to Starbucks' CEO. “The company just announced I’m only getting a 2.5% raise next year, $0.40 an hour, which is hardly anything. It’s one Starbucks drink per week. Starbucks needs to invest in the baristas who make Starbucks run,” she added. A Starbucks spokesperson said Workers United delegates “prematurely ended our bargaining session this week.” Starbucks argued that it offers a “competitive average pay of over $18 per hour, and best-in-class benefits” such as health care, college tuition, paid family leave, and company stock grants. “Workers United proposals call for an immediate increase in the minimum wage of hourly partners by 64%, and by 77% over the life of a three-year year contract. This is not sustainable,” the company said. Starbucks said it is ready to continue negotiations. It comes as the Teamsters union announced Thursday strikes atseveral Amazon delivery facilities, amid the peak holiday delivery rush.

Houthis fire a missile at Tel Aviv; Israeli strikes kill several children in Gaza,"A missile launchedfrom Yemenstruck the Israeli cityof Tel Avivearly Saturday morning, marking a rare instance of a failed interception over the city. The attack came just hours after seven children were killed in northern Gaza on Friday after Israeli airstrikes struck a house in Jabaliya, Palestinian civil defense said, as Israel continues its offensive after 15 months of war that has spilled over into the region. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv's Jaffa district as missile landed in the area after interception attempts failed,according to the Israel Defense Forces. No fatalities were reported, butIsrael’s emergency services saidit was treating 14 people in “mild condition,” after they were injured by glass shards.The Israeli policesaid property damage had also occurred. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi forces claimed responsibility after the strike, announcing that they had launched a hypersonic ballistic missile named “Palestine 2” at anIsraeli military sitein the Jaffa area. “The missile hit its target accurately and the defense and interception systems failed to intercept it,” the Houthis said in a statement released Saturday morning, adding that the attack was in response to “the massacres against our brothers in Gaza.” Hamas praised the strike in a statement shortly afterwards. On Friday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 people in Gaza, according to Reuters, citing health officials. Dr. Muneer Alboursh, the Director General of Health in Gaza, said an attack on a house in Jabaliya in northern Gaza killed 12 people, ""most of them children and a woman."" He called the attack a ""bloody massacre,"" and said the bombing had injured several others. Israeli attacks have killed 45,000 people in Gaza since the start of the war 15 months ago, most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials. The current conflict was sparked when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage. Israel has been trading retaliatory strikes with Houthi rebels since that war began. However, nearly all Houthi missiles have been intercepted over the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, where the group has also targeted commercial vessels. In September,nine people were injuredrunning to shelters after a ballistic missile launched from Yemen crossed into Israel, landing in an open field outside Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv, Israel’s second-largest city, serves as the nation’s commercial and diplomatic hub. Direct impacts on the city from incoming projectiles are uncommon, thanks to Israel’s usually robust air defense systems. On Thursday, the IDF said a school near Tel Aviv was damaged after the “partial interception” of a missile launched from Yemen. Later that day, it said Israel had launched strikes against ""military targets"" on Yemen's western coast and inland, including ""fuel and oil tanks, two power plants, and eight tugboats.""

U.S. to lift $10M bounty on de facto Syrian leader's head,"The U.S. is set to remove the $10 million bounty it had placed on de facto Syrian leader, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre,Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. Sharaa is the head of rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), which led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. The decision follows meetings between U.S. diplomats and HTS in Damascus on Friday in which Sharaa committed to ensuring terrorist groups in Syria do not pose a threat to the U.S. and its allies, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said. The high-level U.S. delegation’s visit to the Syrian capital was the first such trip since the fall of the regime. Leaf, who led the delegation, described the meetings with the interim government as “quite good, very productive,” and “detailed,” covering a wide range of issues both domestic and external. Leaf said Sharaa himself came across as “pragmatic.” “We’ve been hearing this for some time, some very pragmatic and moderate statements on various issues, from women’s rights to protection of, you know, equal rights for all communities, etc,” Leaf told reporters. “Again, it was a good first meeting. We will judge by deeds, not just by words. Deeds are the critical thing.” The U.S. diplomats also stressed the Biden administration’s continued focus on determining the fate of detained or missing Americans in Syria including Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, whotraveled to Damascus in 2020for secret negotiations about Tice during the first Trump administration, was also part of the delegation. Carstens said the information available thus far does not confirm whether Tice, an American journalist who was abducted in Syria 12 years ago, is still alive. “What I can tell you is this, the president the United States said recently that he believes Austin to be alive, and it’s our duty to keep pressing and pushing to see if we can find all the information that we possibly can, to get a sense of, with certainty by the way, what happened to him, where he is, and to bring him home,” Carstens told reporters following the meetings. Carstens said the U.S. was focused on six particular prison sites where they believed there was a high possibility Tice had been held at one point or another, and that in the weeks ahead it will be the duty of the U.S. to search them thoroughly and “fine tune the evidence gathering in a way that only the FBI can do.” In addition to HTS, the diplomats met with members of civil society, activists, members of different communities and other Syrians “about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,” a State Department spokesperson said. “We met with the quite heroic White Helmets to affirm our continued support for their life-saving efforts and tireless work to transform Syria for the better of all Syrians,” Leaf told reporters. “We also held a commemorative event to honor the tens of thousands, Syrians and non-Syrians alike, who were detained, tortured, forcibly disappeared or missing and who brutally perished at the hands of the former regime.” Daniel Rubinstein, a senior adviser for the State Department’s Middle East bureau who will lead the department’s diplomatic engagement on Syria from Washington, said the U.S. hopes to have more regular diplomatic missions to Damascus. “Obviously we need to look at the operational conditions,” Rubenstein said. “We were able to have a successful visit today, and we’re going to try to do them prudently and as frequently as practical.” The U.S. delegation’s visit follows trips by diplomats from France, the U.K. and Germany to Damascus this week as Sharaa calls for the lifting of international sanctions against HTS, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist group. Current U.S. sanctions, including the terrorist designation, do not prevent the government from meeting or speaking with HTS, but they do restrict the provision of material support, creating complications for humanitarian aid groups working to assist both the refugees flooding back to Syria and those displaced within it for the last decade. The Biden administration is exploring removing HTS from its terrorist list,NBC News has reported, but the administration has also laid out a list of conditions the group must meet before the United States would formally recognize the Syrian government. “Our view is that when whatever government arises out of this transition, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to protect the rights of all Syrians, including women and minorities, like all governments, it needs to preserve critical state institutions and deliver essential services,” deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday. “And perhaps most important, we want to see a Syria that does not pose a threat to its neighbors or the regions or being a place that’s going to serve as a base for terrorism or allying with groups like ISIS.” Abigail Williams is a producer and reporter for NBC News covering the State Department.

"There are 'clear signs' of ethnic cleansing by Israel in Gaza, Doctors Without Borders says","There are “clear signs ofethnic cleansing” by Israel as itwages war in Gaza, according to a new report fromDoctors Without Borders, which became the second group in a week to condemn the country's conduct in the besieged enclave. “Our firsthand observations of the medical and humanitarian catastrophe inflicted on Gaza are consistent with the descriptions provided by an increasing number of legal experts and organizations concluding that genocide is taking place in Gaza,” the aid group, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said in the report published Thursday. “In the north of the Strip in particular, the recent military offensive is a clear illustration of the brutal war the Israeli forces are waging on Gaza, and we are witnessing clear signs of ethnic cleansing as Palestinian life is being wiped off the area,” it said. “While we don’t have legal authority to establish intentionality, the signs of ethnic cleansing and the ongoing devastation—including mass killings, severe physical and mental health injuries, forced displacement, and impossible conditions of life for Palestinians under siege and bombardment — are undeniable,” it added. NBC News has asked the Israel Defense forces for comment on the report. It has strongly rejected accusations of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the past, while insisting that it does everything possible to limit the loss of human life. Human Rights Watch, in a separate report also released Thursday,  accused Israeli authorities of intentionally depriving Palestinians in Gaza of access tosafe waterfor drinking and sanitation. “Water is essential for human life, yet for over a year the Israeli government has deliberately denied Palestinians in Gaza the bare minimum they need to survive,” Tirana Hassan, the group’s executive director, said in a statement released alongside the report, “Extermination and Acts of Genocide: Israel Deliberately Depriving Palestinians in Gaza of Water.” “This isn’t just negligence; it is a calculated policy of deprivation that has led to the deaths of thousands,” she added. An IDF spokesperson said that it “firmly rejects allegations asserting it has deliberately targeted water infrastructure in the Gaza Strip,” adding that its strikes in Gaza are carried out in accordance with international law and with “all feasible efforts … taken to mitigate harm to civilians.” The spokesperson added that the military was working to reactivate a desalination plant in Gaza's southern city ofKhan Younis, among other projects that include repairing damaged pipes. But the reports add to a chorus of criticism from aid and rights groups. Amnesty International became the first major nonprofit group to accuse Israel ofacts of genocidein theGaza Stripin a report this month, echoing similar claims from numerous United Nations agencies. At the time, an IDF spokesperson called Amnesty’s claims “entirely baseless.” While war crimes such as genocide are legal designations that would normally be made by a judge, the charities’ accusations will do little to dispel the charges already brought against the government of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Netanyahu for crimes against humanity, along with Yoav Gallant, his former defense minister, as well asHamas military chief Mohammed Deif. Israel said it killed Deif, the head of the Qassam Brigades, in August. Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu’s office branding them “antisemitic,” rejecting the charges as “absurd and false.” Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, told NBC News on Sunday that Israel had filed anappeal of  the ICC warrants. The war in Gaza has raged for 14 months and, according to local officials, more than45,000 peoplehave been killed in Israel's military campaign there. Israeli forces entered Gaza in response to the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around1,200 people Israeliswere killed and around 250 people takenhostage, according to Israeli tallies. Around 100 hostages are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups, although a third are thought to be dead. While Israel has long justified the death toll and high levels of destruction in Gaza in the context of its war against the Iran-backed militia, there appears to be a limited response from Hamas in large parts of Gaza even as its campaign continues, according to Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King’s College London’s school of security studies. “Certainly in part of the Gaza Strip in the north, I would concur with the observation that the intent there is no longer to fight Hamas because there isn’t much resistance left anyway, but it’s the intent of ethnic cleansing and depriving the local population of their livelihood, which is water, electricity, which then has an effect of intentionally killing people,” Krieg said. The Israeli military has insisted that it does everything possible to limit the loss of human life. But many of its actions in Gaza would be  ""permissible, acceptable under any circumstance within a Western military,” Krieg told NBC News Friday, adding that it was important to make the legal distinction between genocide and acts of genocide. “We always think about genocide being some sort of coherent strategy, like in Rwanda, for example, where the government was clearly giving permission to people to kill a particular group of people, and then it’s orchestrated more or less with central supervision,” he said. “That’s obviously not the case here, but the fact is that the IDF has been given an extremely permissive environment.” David Hodari is a London-based editor."
From Brat to 'brain rot': 2024's biggest memes and moments,"Slop, rap beef, brain rot and, yes, “hawk tuah” — what a year it’s been on the internet. The colloquial definition of memes has expanded to include any type of viral internet phenomenon, including slang terms like “rizz” or “skibidi,” that comes alive on social media, according to Don Caldwell, editor-in-chief of Know Your Meme, an online database that tracks trends. “The literacy that is required to understand a meme can be very, very intense and complex, because you need to know five different memes throughout internet history to even get the joke,” Caldwell said. Memes nowadays tend to emerge as references or reactions to something else, such as pop culture or news events, digital culture researcher Jamie Cohen said. “If you’re chronically online or terminally online, a lot of these ways of reading media are almost like making translations in real time,” said Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at City University of New York-Queens College. “Cultural savviness is more required for memes today than they’ve ever been.” For those who were not extremely online this year, NBC News rounded up the biggest memes and moments that shaped 2024. Fromgreen wallstopresidential campaigns, “Brat,” Charli XCX’s sixth studio album, was inescapable this year. The album redefined the word “brat,” serving as a rejection of perfection. To be “brat” is to be, as Charli XCX put it, “honest, blunt and a little bit volatile.” It’s fitting that a record so hedonistic and vulnerable would soundtrack a chaotic year full ofelections,celebrity beef,unprecedented natural disastersand more. Charli XCX had hovered in pop music’s “middle class” for years, but her latest release unexpectedly catapulted her to previously unknown heights. The virality most likely helped her snag multipleGrammy nominations, including one in the coveted album of the year category. First it wasMastodon. ThenThreads. NowBluesky(again). Former Twitter users have been intermittently fleeing what is now X ever since Elon Musk bought it in 2022, but itslargest user exodusbegan right around this year’s election. Over the last month, millions of users — including many celebrities and brands — have flocked to alternative text-based social media apps like Bluesky and Threads, both of which had significant spikes in user signups after the election. Many X users have pointed to growing issues such asbots, partisanadvertisementsandharassment. Following previous waves of users’ abandoning the app for a coveted but still-elusive Twitter replacement, the discontent reached another tipping point this year when Donald Trump was re-elected president with Musk’s support. Meanwhile, Musk has beentouting Xas a replacement to news media outlets. The Olympics were arguably the cultural moment of the year. The 19-day event featured lavish opening and closing ceremonies and a slew of athletic triumphs (including some by Team USA, which took home 125 medals). Many buzzworthy moments gained traction online, turning some competitors into even bigger stars and energizing people watching at home. Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen captivated the world with his TikTok videos about the muffins at the Olympics Village; Kim Ye-ji, a South Korean pistol shooter, and Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikeç impressed viewers with their skills and style; Team USA gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik (aka “pommel horse” guy) and Team USA rugby player Ilona Maher became so popular during the Games that they got cast on “Dancing With the Stars.” It was also a star-filled affair. Céline Dionclosed out the opening ceremonywith her first performance since she announced her diagnosis with stiff-person syndrome in 2022. The Games closed with the literal and figurative passing of the torch to Los Angeles, where the Summer Games will take place in 2028. The ceremony included a Tom Cruise stunt and performances from artists including: H.E.R., the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Billie Eilish. “Hawk tuah” became a massive internet meme this summer when, in response to a street interview asking what move makes a man “go crazy” in bed, Haliey Welch remarked in a Southern twang: “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang.” As the clip gained traction, Welch was launched into overnight stardom, propelled by a Barstool-esque crowd of internet users who lauded her bold, unapologetically sexual humor. Though many online snarked on the merits of her newfound fame, “Hawk Tuah girl” has leveraged the attention to build a brand off the slogan, including her podcast, “Talk Tuah,” and other business ventures. In 2024, everyone became obsessed with being “very mindful” of their actions and acting “very cutesy” or “very demure.” The phrases became online phenomena after a TikTok user named Jools Lebron made a video explaining how she handles a wide variety of daily situations. With the viral fame came an unexpected trademark battle for Lebron after a surprise trademark applicationin Augustsparked a frenzy over the legal rights to the viral phrase. Lebron documented the struggle to gain control over the “Demure” trademark, showcasing justhow difficult it is for creators to monetizetheir sudden internet fame. Eventually, Lebron told her followers, she was able to work out the trademark issue. She has transitioned into a career making content full time, and she said she was able to pay for the rest of her gender transition thanks to the revenue she made from brand deals. Over the past few years, there seems to have been a constant pressure for people online to buy the latest trendy item, from Stanleywater bottlesto clothing emulating thehottest, newest aesthetic. But buying into every fad has strained consumers’ wallets — and created piles of clutter in their homes. “Underconsumption core,” popularized this year on TikTok, encourages people to reject the microtrends and focus on the things they actually use and enjoy on a daily basis. If you remind yourself that you have everything you need, it can be easier to avoid falling into the trap of the newest trends. It is the latest trend to encourage the normalization of not spending money, joining other movements popularized online like “loud budgeting” and “de-influencing."" CreatorAnthony Pois known for putting onoutlandish eventsin New York City, but theTimothée Chalamet lookalike contestis perhaps his pièce de résistance. After thousands — including the real Chalamet — attended the lookalike contest, numerous copycats popped up all around the world. Since the Chalamet event in October, lookalike contests for celebrities like Jeremy Allen White, Zayn Malik, Paul Mescal andDev Patelhave also cropped up, drawing big crowds across various cities. Jesus, but he’s half-shrimp. Flight attendants heroically wading through mud with their Bibles. Deformed, malnourished or chronically ill children begging for birthday “likes.” The explosion of artificial intelligence-generated art gave rise this year toa tsunami of AI slop, usually characterized by its nonsensical anatomical errors and increasingly outlandish image concepts. To many online, the images might be easily recognized as fake. But others are not so discerning. Often shared by networks of Facebook spam pages, such images have received hundreds of millions of engagements from people commenting “Amen” on the bizarre biblically themed imagery, praising the efforts of an AI-generated child who supposedly built an elaborate statue out of plastic bottles or wishing happy birthday to fake children sitting pitifully in the mud. The phenomenon has amused and befuddled users, with some wondering whether bot activity or potential scammers are involved. This year brought theresurgence of the diss track, a crucial tool in hip-hop culture for hashing out rivalries. At the center of the trend were rappers Drake and Kendrick Lamar, whose longtime feud reached a boiling point this year. The squabble first blew up online when Lamar dissed Drake and J. Cole in his song “Like That,” a collab with Future and Metro Boomin released in March. Drake in turn responded with his own diss tracks “Push Ups” and “Taylor Made Freestyle,” the latter of which he took down afterhe faced legal actionfor using the AI-generated voice of the late Tupac Shakur. Their back-and-forth continued throughout the summer as the rappers churned out track after track. Drake tooktheir beef to court— claiming in a filing last month that Universal Music Group, the distributor for both rappers’ labels, “artificially inflated” numbers for Lamar’s “Not Like Us” on Spotify. Oxford University Press defines “brain rot,” itsword of the year, as ""the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration.” The term has primarily been linked to Gen Alpha, defined as children born after 2010, who have created their own language within their online communities. Brain rot lingo is often associated with words like: “sigma,” someone who is cool or a leader; “gyatt,” which is an exclamation for a curvaceous woman; and “Skibidi,” as in “Skibidi Toilet,” a term derived from aYouTube seriesthat is now used to mean basically anything.

'Hawk Tuah Girl' says she’s 'cooperating' with lawyers in suit related to crash of meme crypto,"Internet star Haliey Welch, also known as the “Hawk Tuah Girl,” said Friday she is “fully cooperating” with attorneys who are representing people impacted by the recent crash of crypto meme coin $HAWK. Welch helped launch the cryptocurrency, named after her viral catchphrase, earlier this month. Within hours after the digital coin was made available, its price plummeted and the 22-year-old influencerfaced accusationsthat it was a scam. At the time, Welch’s team blamed “snipers” — bots programmed to buy tokens immediately upon launch and sell when prices spike — for causing the market cap fluctuation. Investors of the $HAWK coin filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the coin’s creators, accusing the company overHere Ltd., its founder, Clinton So, Tuah The Moon Foundation and social media influencer Alex Larson Schultz of unlawfully promoting and selling cryptocurrency that they say was never properly registered with the SEC. The suit, a copy of which was reviewed by NBC News, was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. It does not name Welch as a defendant. In a post on X on Friday, Welch responded to the lawsuit, urging those who “experienced losses related to this” to contact the law firm Burwick PLLC. “I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community,” shewrote. “I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the truth, hold the responsible parties accountable, and resolve this matter.” A spokesperson for Welch did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Friday. Burwick PLLC, which teamed up with law firm Wolf Popper LLC, said that $HAWK’s token market capitalization “surged” to $491 million after launching on Dec. 4, but its “meteoric rise was short-lived, as the $HAWK token’s value plummeted by over 90% within hours, dropping below $100 million.” “This extreme volatility left many investors, particularly first-time cryptocurrency investors drawn in by Haliey Welch’s involvement, facing significant financial losses,” the two firms wrote in anews releaseFriday. Wolf Popper LLP and Burwick Law said they are “seeking to recover on behalf of the plaintiffs’ and the class’s purchases of $HAWK tokens.” Welch jumped into the crypto craze after months of growing her brand. Since June, when her interview went viral, she has cashed in on her success with Hawk Tuah-themed merch, her podcast “Talk Tuah” and the launch of her AI dating assistant app Pookie Tools. In the days leading up to the $HAWK’s launch, she promoted it in several posts on X. In an interview withFortune, she said she used to think of crypto as “just a scam” and an “easy way for you to lose money.” However, she said she began seeing it as a “good way to interact with fans” after attending several cryptocurrency conferences. In a Dec. 4 post on X following the initial controversy, Welch said that she and the people behind the coin have not sold any of their holdings. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies such as DOGE (named after the iconic doge meme) and MOODENG (named after the viral baby pygmy hippo), that were inspired by internet memes. Their performance in the market can be volatile, depending largely on the hype generated by social media trends. Butsome memecoins have also courted controversy, and celebrities who have touted crypto coins without transparency about their financial incentiveshave also faced scrutiny and legal action. In a joint statementon Xon Friday, Wolf Popper LLP and Burwick Law wrote, “Sadly, this is one of many memecoin cases where institutional greed has exploited celebrities and their influence to harm everyday people.""

'Elf' gets Broadway makeover as a musical,"Fans of the 2003 Christmas movie “Elf” can now follow the journey of Buddy on Broadway, where “Elf the Musical” is playing for a limited time this holiday season. Grey Henson takes on the role of Buddy, the elf made famous on the big screen by Will Ferrell as the human boy raised by elves who travels to New York City to find his biological father. Henson, who was nominated for a Tony for his role as Damian in Tina Fey’s Broadway adaptation of “Mean Girls,” has performed in shows like “The Book of Mormon” and “Shucked.” But the pressure of playing a role that people already know and love proved challenging, he said. “People come in expecting a certain performance, but I think they’re pleasantly surprised by how different it feels,” Henson said recently. “And immediately, once you see me not in exactly what Will Ferrell wore in the movie, you’re like, ‘OK, this is the same guy I know, but it’s different.’ “I honestly have to stop thinking about the movie for my performance just because I don’t want to try to do an impression of Will Ferrell.” The actors said they brought their own twists to each role, including that of Jovie, Buddy's grumpy love interest who works as an elf in a department store, played by Broadway alum Kayla Davion. She eventually finds Christmas joy through Buddy. “In the most blunt terms, I’m Black,” she said. “I like to bring my Chicago side into it, which is a very chill version of myself. And honestly, my sassy side is very direct, which is kind of nice for this role.” In this adaptation, Santa Claus is played by Sean Astin, known for “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Goonies.” Buddy’s stepmom, Emily Hobbs, is portrayed by Ashley Brown, who originated the role of Mary Poppins on Broadway in 2006. The manager of the store where Buddy accidentally gets thrown in as an elf in the Christmas section is played by Kalen Allen, an actor, singer and content creator who regularly appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” “I think a piece of me almost felt that maybe I was never going to be able to do stage again,” Allen said about his time on TV. “It felt like I was being called back home.” Feeling at home is a strong theme as Buddy tries to build a relationship with his estranged father, a high-strung corporate worker on the naughty list portrayed by Michael Hayden, and make it in the human world. “He’s a fish out of water. He’s a bull in a china shop,” Henson said. “And everything that you love about the movie is really in our show. But obviously we’re singing and dancing, which adds 10 times more holiday cheer.” Davion said many theatergoers have told her they cried watching “Elf” on Broadway because “the Christmas spirit is so real.” Allen said the show teaches people that “Christmas is more than just presents and gifts.” “It’s about connection,” he said. “It’s about families, about friends.” Henson said that because the stage version is a musical, “it’s a little bit more emotional.” This is the third time “Elf” has hit the Broadway stage, after debuting in 2011 and playing again in 2012. Its current incarnation runs through Jan. 4. Fans of the movie might notice a few plot changes and missing scenes, but in their place are big musical numbers, tap dancing, onstage skating and a theater filled with snow. But it does include one of the most famous scenes from the movie, plates of spaghetti. “[It’s] always real spaghetti. But instead of syrup, we use honey because it’s better for voices,” said 13-year-old Kai Edgar, who plays Buddy’s little brother, Michael. As in the movie, the play ends with Santa’s sleigh taking flight after getting enough magic and holiday cheer to fuel it, and the Broadway audience gets to experience that firsthand as the sleigh soars offstage and over the orchestra seats. “The fact that we are able to bring so much wonderment and magic every single night, it never gets old,” Allen said.

Bans on transgender care for minors may complicate eating disorder treatment,"Restrictions ongender-affirming careproposed by Republicans in Congress and President-elect Donald Trump could be devastating for transgender youths, doctors say, especially for teens with eating disorders. Gender-affirming care — which includes mental health counseling and sometimes puberty-suppressing medication and hormone therapy —is a critical part of carefor trans teens with eating disorders, said Jessie Menzel, a psychologist and vice president of development at Equip Health, which provides virtual mental health care for people with eating disorders. Eating disordersare pervasive among young peoplewho identify as trans. Many starve themselves or develop other harmful eating behaviorsto make their bodies conform toa masculine or feminine ideal.Studies estimatethat25%to more than50%of trans people have had eating disorders,compared with 9%of the overall population. Yet transition-related care is increasingly out of reach for minors struggling with gender dysphoria, the acute distress thatresults from a mismatchbetween one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. Most U.S. medical associationsconsider transition-related care to be essentialfor minors struggling with gender dysphoria. Twenty-six states alreadyban such carefor people under 18, and Trump said he will implement nationwide restrictions. Trumphas vowed to “stop” gender-affirming treatmentsfor minors andpunish doctorswho provide them. A massive spending billthe HouseandSenate passedthis month includes aban on using military health insurancefor gender-affirming care for children of service members. Public opinion polls show that Americans are divided over transition-related care for minors. A Gallup survey published in Junefound that 51% of respondentsagreed that “changing one’s gender is morally wrong,” although 60% also oppose laws banning transition-related care. Many people who oppose such caresay that minors are too youngto understand the risks of hormonal therapies and that they are concerned about the lack of long-term data on potential side effects. Although the effects of puberty-blocking medications are largely reversible, they can cause a temporary reduction in bone density. Taking the hormones estrogen or testosterone, which many trans teens eventually receive, restores most of that bone loss. Gender-affirming surgeryis rarely performedon patients under 18, and hospitals require parental consent before they provide any transition-related care. But forbidding that type of care can also cause harm, and state banshave been linked to increased suicide attemptsby trans youths. Additional restrictions could lead more kids to develop eating disorders and make it harder for people with eating disorders to recover, Menzel said. “We are absolutely going to see an increase in eating disorders amongst these individuals,” Menzel said. Carsen Rhys Beckwith, 27, of Kansas City, Missouri, said they developed an eating disorder around age 14, as they began developing the curves typically associated with female bodies. But Beckwith didn’t feel female. They wanted to look muscular and more masculine. “My body was developing in a way that didn’t match how my identity was developing,” said Beckwith, who identifies as nonbinary and transmasculine. Beckwithbegan trying to change their body the only way they could: by losing weight and constantly working out at the gym. “It started with counting calories,” said Beckwith. After a while, Beckwith was subsisting on a single piece of fruit a day. “I would give most of my lunch away to my friends and think, ‘I don’t need to eat until dinner.’” For trans teens with eating disorders, receiving gender-affirming care —a comprehensive approachthat validates a young person’s feelings, provides psychological support and, in many cases,includes hormonal therapies— can reduce their need to lose weight, Menzel said. “It’s life-changing for them to be able to have access to somebody who is willing to listen to them,” Menzel said. “Just having someone who is willing to affirm who they are can make such a big difference.” Puberty-blocking hormonescan give trans teens a temporary reprievefrom developing more adult bodies, giving them time to explore their gender identities with therapy, Menzel said. Other hormonal therapies, such as estrogen and testosterone, typically taken later in the teen years, can help children grow into bodies that match their gender identities. Dr. Ellen Rome, a pediatrician and head of the center for adolescent medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital, said gender-affirming care can help teens feel better about their bodies and their relationships with food. “When a kid is living as who they want to be,” Rome said, “often the eating disorder symptoms are relatively easy to eradicate.” Although Ohio’s ban allows children currently receiving gender-affirming care to continue the treatments, doctorsare no longer allowedto prescribe the medications for new patients under 18. “They have taken that tool out of our toolbox,” Rome said. Gender-affirming care — like trans rights in general — has become a hot-button political issue. During the presidential campaign, Trumpfalsely claimed that children were undergoinggender-affirming surgery during the school day. Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of the influential conservative group Moms for Liberty, dismisses gender-affirming care for minors as “child abuse” and “snake oil,” and she said her organization is working to ban gender-affirming care for minors in every state. Gender-affirming care is endorsed by every major U.S. medical association, including theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, theAmerican Medical Associationand theAmerican Academy of Child  and Adolescent Psychiatry. The AMA notes that trans teens who receive gender-affirming carehave “dramatically reduced ratesof suicide attempts, decreased rates of depression and anxiety, decreased substance use, improved HIV medication adherence and reduced rates of harmful self-prescribed hormone use.” Children who are desperately unhappy — and unable to delay puberty in any other way — may take matters into their own hands, said Dr. Jason Nagata, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. Trans boys, for example, sometimesavoid eating, because they know that without enough daily calories, they won’t begin menstruation, Nagata said. “Some people will intentionally restrict their food intake to get rid of their periods,” Nagata said. “We have seen that a lot, particularly when people can’t get gender-affirming care.” Trans girls also sometimes try to delay the effects of puberty through starvation, Nagata said. “If they really restrict their food intake, they can prevent themselves from developing facial hair or Adam’s apples.” Eating disorders can be life-threatening, Nagata said. Anorexia, a condition in which people severely restrict their calorie intake,has the second-highest mortality rateof any psychiatric disorder, behind only opioid addiction. It can cause abnormal heart rhythms, anemia, bone loss and brain damage. About 5% of peopledie within four years of anorexia diagnoses. Even with intensive treatment, relapse rates are high. Fewer than half of people with anorexiamake full recoveries. Research shows such state bans on gender-affirming careheighten the stress and anxietywith which many trans people already live. Calls to a mental health crisis line run by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent suicide in LGBTQ youths,rose 700%the day after the November election. A recent study in Nature found that suicide attempts among trans youthsincreased 72%in states that outlawed gender-affirming care for minors. Both trans children and those with eating disordershave elevated rates of self-harm and suicide, Menzel said. If lawmakers ban puberty-blocking hormones, Menzel predicts, more trans teens will look for ways to stop the process themselves. Beckwith said they owe their recovery to transition-related health care and the support of other trans people. Eight years ago, Beckwith began taking testosterone, which they describe as “lifesaving.” Although they still sometimes need to be reminded to eat more, Beckwith said they are much healthier than they were in college, when they contemplated suicide. “I still have days when I have thoughts that creep back in,” said Beckwith, a program director at Project HEAL, an advocacy group that aims to increase access to treatment for eating disorders. Thanks to mental health counseling, “I have so much more practice now in rewiring those thoughts and leaning on the people around me who can affirm me and lift me up.” Liz Szabo is an independent health and science journalist.

FDA approves weight loss drug Zepbound for sleep apnea,"The Food and Drug Administration expanded the approval of weight loss drug Zepbound to treat obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, thedrugmaker Eli Lilly said Friday. The decision makes it the first drug treatment for the disorder, which affects about39 million adults in the United States. Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, is already approved by the FDA to treat adults who are overweight or have obesity. The expanded approval could persuade more insurance companies — which have been reluctant to cover the expensive weight loss drugs — to pay for the medication. “Too often, OSA [obstructive sleep apnea] is brushed off as ‘just snoring’ — but it’s far more than that,” Julie Flygare, president and CEO of Project Sleep, a nonprofit group that raises awareness of sleep health, said in a statement. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep, cutting off airflow throughout the night. Often a person is jolted awake gasping for oxygen, contributing to fragmented, poor sleep.Obesity, which can narrow the airway, is one of the leading contributors to sleep apnea.Left untreated, it can lead to diabetes, heart arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and brain damage. A study of more than 4,000 peoplepresented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting in Aprilfound people with sleep apnea may also be more likely to have memory or thinking problems. The approval supports evidence that GLP-1 drugs improve overall health along with weight loss. In March, the FDA approved Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, to reduce heart disease risk. Other studies are underway to determine whether GLP-1s can help prevent Alzheimer’s, curb addiction and delay kidney disease. It is unclear how Zepbound helps people with sleep apnea — whether it is through weight loss or because tirzepatide, its active ingredient, is doing something else in the body. The approval is based on two trials of men and women with obesity and moderate to severe sleep apnea. In Lilly's sleep apnea research, people who took Zepbound lost around 20% of their body weight on average. Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, said that when people with sleep apnea lose weight, their symptoms generally improve. “But as we’ve seen, weight loss without medication is hard to do,” Spratt said. Many people who have sleep apnea go undiagnosed and untreated. Currently, obstructive sleep apnea is managed with PAP, or positive airway pressure, machines, which gently blow air into the airway to keep it from collapsing. CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, is the most commonly prescribed form of PAP. Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, noted that CPAP machines work quickly, have few health complications and are usually inexpensive. Over the last few years, however, patients have been frustrated after a major CPAP manufacturer, Phillips Respironics, recalled millions of its machines in 2021 after it found that its noise-canceling foam could break down and be inhaled. Some patients do not tolerate CPAP machines well, Morgenthaler said, leading them to explore alternatives, such as surgery, which is costly, or oral devices, which are not as effective as CPAP. That has left room for growing interest in drug options, like GLP-1s, he said. A weekly injectable like Zepbound could free people from an inconvenient machine — or be used in combination for more effective treatment. “Weight loss alone can significantly reduce OSA severity for many patients, though tirzepatide may have other mechanisms that could be beneficial,” Morgenthaler said. “However, challenges include its high cost, side effects and the need for long-term management plans, which are still being studied.” Lilly researchers looked at whether Zepbound worked better than a placebo in reducing how many times per hour, on average, a person partly or fully stopped breathing during sleep. PAP machines were not used in the first study, but they were used in the second. After 52 weeks, the drug had led to an average reduction of 25 events per hour in people who were not on PAP machines, compared with a reduction of five events per hour for people on the placebo. In people who did use PAP machines, Zepbound led to an average reduction of 29 events per hour, compared with an average reduction of six events per hour for the placebo group. After one year, 42% of adults on Zepbound and 50% of adults on Zepbound with PAP therapy experienced remission or reduced symptoms, according to Lilly. The approval is an “incredible step forward,” Spratt said, althoughdetermining whether Zepbound is superior to PAP would require a head-to-head trial. “The risk of sleep apnea increases with weight gain,” she said. Morgenthaler said other treatments are still needed, noting that 30% to 40% of sleep apnea patients suffer from insomnia, as well, and that opening the airway alone does not provide relief. “We need to realize that treating OSA is not simply about keeping the airway open during sleep,” he said.

"Moderate drinking linked to lower risk of death, but there's a major catch","A majorreport releasedthis week found that compared with abstaining from alcohol, moderate drinking was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause and a lower risk of death from heart disease, but it was also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Far from settling the debate over whetherdrinking in moderation is healthy or dangerous, the report’s conclusions furthermuddied the issue. The report, released Tuesday, was commissioned by Congress and carried out by a committee from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. An update to federal dietary guidelines next year could include new recommendations about how much alcohol people should drink. Thecurrent guidelinesrecommend people limit alcoholic beverages and say that if they choose to drink, they should do so in moderation, defined as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women. But over the last few years, mounting evidence has questioned the health benefits of drinking. In 2022, theWorld Health Organizationconcluded that no amount of alcohol is safe. Alarge reportthis year found that heavy drinking is linked to six cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, the esophagus, the liver and the stomach. For the report, the committee reviewed research dating to 2010 to look at the relationship between moderate drinking and a number of outcomes, including death from any cause, death from heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, weight changes and Alzheimer’s disease. “We looked at that body of literature and were able to make three conclusions with what we call moderate certainty, and what that means is that we feel comfortable in making these conclusions based on the evidence we had available,” said Dr. Ned Calonge, chair of the NASEM committee. Calonge and his team stopped short of linking moderate drinking to colorectal cancer, saying there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion, though that could change in the future with more research. Dr. Michael Siegel, a Tufts University public health and community medicine professor, said the cancer connection should be the main takeaway from the new report. “Essentially, what this means is that alcohol is clearly a carcinogen,” Siegel said. “There isn’t a level of moderate or light drinking that can be recommended to people, because at that level it will increase their cancer risk.” Dr. Michael Pignone, a professor of medicine at Duke University, said that he hasn’t seen enough evidence to tell people to stop drinking but that they shouldn’t start. “I am skeptical that low levels of alcohol consumption really reduce mortality or cardiovascular mortality,” Pignone said. “I would not recommend someone start drinking for health benefits.” A second report conducted by a group within the Department of Health and Human Services to be published in the coming weeks will also help inform the 2025 guidelines. “I think this report sort of highlights all the things that we don’t know,” said Dr. Nicholas Lim, a hepatologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, adding he hopes it will prompt better research to clarify understanding of alcohol and health.

Houston Texans wide receiver Tank Dell goes down with apparent knee injury,"Houston Texans star receiver Tank Dell went down with an apparent gruesome knee injury in the third quarter of Saturday's contest against the Kansas City Chief. The injury, which led to Dell being carted off the field, was so devastating it had several of his teammates holding back tears on the sidelines. The injury occurred on a play that Houston initially celebrated -- a 30-yard touchdown catch by Dell from quarterback CJ Stroud that pulled the Texans (9-5) within 17-16 on the scoreboard. As Dell caught the pass in the back of the end zone, however, he was hit near the knee by teammate Jared Wayne, who had also been running a deep route into the end zone. Dell was quickly tended to by medical personnel before being loaded onto a stretcher. Stroud, who last season called Dell his closest friend on the Texans roster, was emotional watching the aftermath of the play. It could be the second major leg injury of Dell’s career, after a broken leg sidelined him during his rookie season in 2023. Saturday’s game had long been defined by injuries, after the spotlight all week had been on whether Chiefs (13-1) quarterback Patrick Mahomes would play after suffering an ankle injury only six days earlier. Mahomes started, however, and even rushed for a 15-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Andrew Greif is a freelance sports journalist."
Manchester City was the most dominant team in world football. Now it can't win a game.,"Right now, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has the look of Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus when Rome fell in A.D. 476. He knows his masterpiece is falling, and he is powerless to stop it from crumbling. Last weekend, Manchester City conceded two late goals in the Manchester derby, or rivalry match, to lose to bitter rivals Manchester United 2-1. City fans inside their Etihad Stadium home sat in near silence. Nobody was angry. They’ve witnessed greatness for almost a decade under Guardiola, but this silence was somber. Absolutely nobody saw this run of just one win in the last 12 games in all competitions coming. Manchester City has won six of the last seven English Premier League titles and eight of the last 13. It’s a dynasty. A few months ago it became the only team in English soccer history to win four straight top flight titles. It won the treble (the Premier League, European Champions League and FA Cup trophies) the season before that, becoming just the second team in English history to do so. Everything was going historically well. What could possibly go wrong? Fast-forward a few months, and City is broken. Badly. It has lost six of its last eight Premier League games. It lost just 11 Premier League games in total over the previous three seasons combined. This feels like the beginning of the end of Guardiola’s incredible reign as City’s marauding, all-conquering emperor in the most competitive league on the planet. Usually we’d say yes. Given the quality of players it has, the depth of its squad and the manager, after a slow start to a season City usually improves in the second half and kicks on to win trophies. But this feels different. The current signs aren’t good. City playmaker Bernardo Silva scolded his teammates for their decision-making late on in the shocking collapse against Manchester United last weekend. “At this level, if it’s a game or two, you can say it’s lucky or unlucky, but if it’s 10 games, it is not about that,” Silva said. “It’s a lot of games lately. ... We have to look at ourselves. It’s the decisions that you make. Today, the last minutes, we played like under 15s, and we paid the price.” And that is the crux of this problem. Guardiola’s “total football” philosophy relies on taking risks in possession, piling players forward to have a numerical advantage in the final third and keeping the ball and making good decisions. But what happens when you don’t and you lose the ball? City always had Rodri, a defensive midfielderjust voted the best player on the planet, to plug the gaps, cover cracks, win the ball back and be the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card. But Rodri went down with a season-ending knee injury in September against Arsenal. That’s when this all started. Rodri’s importance to City was clear, but nobody realized just how much of an impact his injury would have, simply because he has pretty much been ever-present since he arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2019. City has tried everything to replace Rodri over the last few months, but Guardiola, usually a genius in solving problems with creative solutions, has run out of ideas. City’s only hope is to sign a sensationally talented defensive midfielder in the January transfer window to plug the Rodri gap. But that would really only paper over the cracks of an aging, injury-hit squad that has so many stars limping over the hill at the same time. We’ve seen this happen before in European soccer. Manchester United’s legendary side under Sir Alex Ferguson aged overnight and descended into chaos, and United haven’t won a league title since he left in 2013. Barcelona’s dream team was kept around too long and was left to crumble together as Lionel Messi kept waving his wand to make it seem like an illusion, until it fell apart. Chelsea’s star core eroded quickly in 2011 aside from its sensational last hurrah in winning the Champions League in 2012. Real Madrid’s famed Galacticos wilted in 2008 just as Barcelona’s young stars emerged. The only saving grace for City is that there is no clear pretender to take its place as the top dog in English soccer. Yet. Liverpool is early in its new project under new manager Arne Slot. Arsenal appears to have taken a step back this season. Chelsea’s talented young squad is a few years from realizing its potential. Manchester United is in a massive rebuild, again. Amid all of its struggles this season, City is still within touching distance of the title. But from defending better to finding a Rodri replacement to keeping star players fit, it has to knit it all back together at the same time. Now. There can be no more ""under 15s"" decision-making. This topsy-turvy Premier League season has given City a chance to salvage its season. Over the festive period, City can put itself back in the title race with a favorable schedule before it faces Chelsea and Arsenal in early 2025. If it can navigate the next month without a hiccup, and it still can, there’s a chance City can get itself back in the title hunt. A small chance. There is, of course, the possibility that Guardiola, who only just signed a new contract that runs until the summer of 2027, could walk away this season. He isn’t under pressure from the Abu Dhabi-based owners. Guardiola was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle when he arrived in 2016. He turned City’s expensively assembled machine into a winning juggernaut while playing soccer in its most beautiful form. Even if City finishes outside the Premier League’s top six this season, it will back Guardiola to rebuild the team and go again. If that is what he wants. But there is a lot going on at City right now. It has been charged with 115 breaches of Premier League rules, and that hearing has been going on over the last few months, all while City has been crumbling on the pitch. It’s expected that a verdict will arrive soon. Guardiola has said multiple times he will stay if City is handed a hefty punishment or even relegated from the Premier League to the lower leagues of English soccer. But nobody ever factored in that City would be struggling to win a game and look such a mess and that Guardiola might not be good enough for the job. Not our words. His. “I’m not good enough,” Guardiola said after the defeat against Manchester United. “I am the boss, the manager, I have to find solutions, and so far I haven’t.” “So far” is the key phrase there, though. It suggests Guardiola, one of the greatest and most successful managers in the history of the game, still believes he can turn this around. But if this keeps on getting worse, Guardiola may decide to leave before his reputation is tarnished. City will then be in chaos, with no clear successor lined up and a squad of very talented players all recruited to play in a very specific Guardiola way. Plus, it could be looking for a new manager and rebuilding an aging squad all while uncertainty continues about its future because of those alleged breaches of Premier League rules. Amid this horrendous run of form for one of the greatest teams soccer has ever seen, there is a very real fear among Manchester City fans that things are about to get a lot worse. When a team starts to crumble like this, it happens very suddenly, and there isn’t a quick fix. City’s fan base has a notoriously downbeat outlook on the team, and that remains despite all the winning in recent years. But if Guardiola leaves and City’s season descends into chaos on and off the pitch, the gallows humor its fans are famous for will intensify. And it might not mask the pain of what is about to come. The next few weeks are crucial on and off the pitch in determining how Guardiola’s reign will come to an end. Whatever happens this season, he and City can say quite confidently “veni, vidi, vici” when all is said and done. For now, one of soccer’s great dynasties is limping on.

Dennis Rodman apologizes to daughter Trinity after she acknowledged their estranged relationship,"NBA legend Dennis Rodman issued an Instagram apology tohis daughter Trinity Rodmanafter she spoke about their estranged relationship on a podcast and said they are bonded “maybe by blood but nothing else.” Trinity Rodman, a 22-year-old American soccer star and Olympic gold medalist, said on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast Wednesday that she and her brother spent years not hearing from their father. She recalled how he failed to support them financially at times — even when they were homeless — and accused him of making a show to support her athletic career only when there are cameras around. Her father, a five-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer who secured three titles with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s alongside Michael Jordan, said Thursday in an apologyposted on Instagram: “Sorry I wasn’t the Dad you wanted me to be but either way I still tried and I still Try and Never will Stop.” He shared a video of an array of photos of him with his two kids when they were young. “I will keep Trying even when you’re being told as an adult not to respond to my phone calls. I will try even when it’s difficult and if it takes a long time. I’m always here And tell you all the time rather it’s your voice or voicemail how proud I am,” he continued. “I always had one wish and it was I wish my kids would call me and come see me. Hopefully one day I can get that. I’m here and I’m still trying pick up the phone you have my number, You see me calling, I’m still here Dennis RODMAN- Dad,” he wrote. He added that he watches his daughter play soccer even when she doesn't know it. “FYI: I watch you play All the time😊 (actually flew in to watch you play and was told not to show up bc who I was with instead and me just wanting to support you So I watched you from my hotel balcony just to make everybody happy. I love All My Kids,” he said. Trinity Rodman and her older brother, DJ, are Dennis Rodman’s children from his relationship with Michelle Moyer. They separated when Trinity Rodman was still a toddler in a drawn-out divorce that lasted from 2004 to 2012. Trinity Rodman, who became the youngest player drafted into the National Women’s Soccer League when she was 18, is a star for the Washington Spirit and helped the United States bring home gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. During the podcast, she spoke about how her father showed up to the NWSL quarterfinal match in 2021, sending her into tears. They had a catch-up after the game, but she didn’t see or hear from him again until sometime in the last year. “I think after that was when I lost hope in ever getting him back. It was just going to be, like, he’s popping in whenever he wants to be in a camera,” she said. “And even at that game, I don’t think that was for me. I think he wanted to have a good conscience and then be like, headline, Dennis Rodman showed up to his daughter’s game.” During the conversation, she acknowledged that alcohol has been an issue for her father. Dennis Rodman was known in his career for his antics on and off the court and hard-partying lifestyle. “I think with how successful he was and how rich he was, he was surrounded by a lot of toxic people who would take his money and take advantage of him,” she said. “Because he was in alcohol, he was brainwashed and didn’t really have any control over anything.” “I do believe that he wishes that he could fight his demons. I roll my eyes because it’s like you hear something so many times, but he does nothing to change it. ‘I wish I was a better dad,’ he said that in so many interviews. I could pull them up. And it’s like, OK, yeah, then do something,” she said. Marlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
"Netflix secures U.S. rights to the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2027, 2031","Netflixon Fridayannouncedit has secured exclusive rights in the U.S. to the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2027 and 2031. The announcement comes just days before Netflix willstreamits first ever National League Football Christmas Day games. Adding the Women’s World Cup to its portfolio shows the streaming giant is continuing to bulk up its sports rights portfolio. It also comes as the popularity of women’s sports hasrisenin the last year. “I’ve seen the fandom for the FIFA Women’s World Cup grow tremendously — from the electric atmosphere in France in 2019, and most recently, the incredible energy across Australia and New Zealand in 2023,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said in a press release. “Bringing this iconic tournament to Netflix is not just about streaming matches — it’s about celebrating the players, the culture, and the passion driving the global rise of women’s sports.” The 2027 tournament is set to take place in 12 cities across Brazil. The host country for the 2031 tournament is yet to be announced. Netflix said that coverage of the Women’s World Cup will include commentary and entertainment from studio shows and top-tier talent, as well as Netflix-original documentaries around major players and the sport’s rapidly growing fanbase in the lead up to the tournament. The Women’s World Cup hascontinued to grow in popularity, andmore people in the U.S.tuned in for the women’s final in 2019 than the men’s in 2018. U.S. viewershipdropped substantiallyin 2023, however, after the two-time defending champions were knocked out in the Round of 16. As the audience for the WNBA and women’s national soccer team has grown significantly in the U.S., soccer remains one of the most popular sports globally. Netflix has 282.7 million global memberships, and the streamer has been pushing for growth internationally in part through its cheaper, ad-supported tier. Sports media rights have also exploded in valuation for media companies as live sports beckon the biggest audiences. Netflix has continued to grow into the sports category, streaming a Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight last month, which was watched by 108 million people, making it themost-streamed sporting event ever, according to Netflix. On Christmas Day, the streamer is set to cover the NFL double-header featuring the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. the Houston Texans.

NASA's solar probe is about to fly closer to the sun than any human-made object ever,"NASA is preparing to “taste” the sun on Christmas Eve. The agency’sParker Solar Probeis days away from making its closest-ever approach to the sun on Tuesday, swooping nearer to our star than any other human-made object in history. The spacecraft, which is about the size of a small car, is set to dive within 3.86 million miles of the solar surface at 6:40 a.m. ET on Tuesday. It will fly by at about 430,000 mph,according to NASA. “If you can imagine, it’s like going 96% of the way there to the sun’s surface,” said Kelly Korreck, a program scientist in NASA’s heliophysics division. Mission controllers won’t be able to communicate with the probe during the maneuver, so NASA will have to wait about three days to pick up a signal that the spacecraft survived its rendezvous with the sun. After that, the first images from the close encounter will likely be beamed back to Earth sometime in January, the agency said. As the Parker Solar Probe swoops close to the sun, it will likely fly through plumes of solar plasma and could even dive into active regions of the star, Korreck said. The mission was designed to study the outermost part of the sun’s atmosphere, an ultrahot region known as the corona. Scientists are keen to observe the corona up close because researchers have long puzzled over why the outer layer of the sun’s atmosphere is hundreds of times hotter than the star’s surface. Observing the corona will also help researchers study how storms that brew on the sun’s surface erupt into space. The probe will, for instance, be able to observe streams of the highest-energy solar particles as they are hurled from the sun, exploding into the cosmos at supersonic speeds. “This is the birthplace ofspace weather,” Korreck said. “We’ve observed space weather from afar, but now Parker is living through it. Now we’ll be able to understand better how space weather forms, and when we see storms on the sun in our telescopes, we’ll be able to say what that means for us here on Earth.” During periods of intense space weather, the sun can unleash giant solar flares and streams of charged particles, known as solar wind, directly at Earth. When these outbursts interact with our planet’s magnetic field, they can damage satellites and knock out power grids — along withsupercharging the northern lights. Korreck said the Parker Solar Probe mission will help researchers better forecast space weather and its potential consequences, similar to the work that meteorologists and atmospheric scientists do for weather on Earth. The Parker probe launched into space in 2018 and has circled the sun more than 20 times since then. The Christmas Eve flyby will be the first of three final close swings planned for the mission. The spacecraft was named for Eugene Parker, a pioneering astrophysicist at the University of Chicago who first theorized the existence of solar wind. Parker died in 2022 at the age of 94. Last month, the spacecraft flew by Venus in a maneuver that was designed to help slingshot the probe close to the sun. The upcoming close approach was timed to coincide with the mostactive period of the sun’s 11-year cycle of activity. This busy phase, which is typically characterized by a flurry of solar storms and high magnetic activity, is known as the solar maximum. Scientists like Korreck are hoping the Parker Solar Probe will have a front-row seat if any storms are roiling on the surface of the sun on Christmas Eve.

An aquatic mouse and an ugly blob-headed fish are among new species discovered in the Amazon,"An amphibious mouse with webbed feet and an unsightly blob-headed fish are among the more than two dozen new species scientists discovered in a remote region of thePeruvian Amazonrainforest. A 2022 expedition toPeru’snorthwestern Alto Mayo region, which is heavilyforested, saw thefirst documentationof at least 27 species that are new to science, according to a recent report in Conservation International’s Rapid Assessment Program Bulletin of Biological Assessment. The haul ofnew specieswas also accompanied by another 48 species that are potentially new to science but require further analysis, the report said. “Overall, the RAP team encountered exceptionally high levels of biodiversity that far exceeded expectations considering most of the study sites were located near communities and towns,” the report said, adding that the findings “highlight the importance of research and conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.” In addition to the amphibious mouse and unusual-looking catfish, scientists discovered another type of mouse with stiff, spiny fur and a squirrel only distantly related to others known by science, as well as a new bat and several types of fish, butterflies and amphibians. While discovering new species of insects and even fish is not uncommon, the most significant takeaway from the report is the documentation of new mammals, said Chris Jiggins, an evolutionary biology professor at Britain's University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study. “It’s astonishing — to find four new species of mammals unknown to science is pretty impressive. The amphibious mouse is something I’ve never heard of. It’s quite extraordinary,” Jiggins told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday. This is the first report in which scientists have described these species; the Indigenous groups in the area who assisted scientists in their work have extensive knowledge about many of them, said Trond Larsen, the head of Conservation International’s Rapid Assessment Program and one of the report’s authors. “It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awajun people. They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,” Larsen told Reuters. While Larsen and his team were understandably thrilled about finding the previously unknown species — one of the squirrels was “adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown color, very fast,” Larsen added — the report Conservation International released also highlights the need to do more to protect endangered species. The RAP paper noted that the exhibition also documented 49 species designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature — the global authority on the matter — including two types of critically endangeredmonkeys. “These forests in the foothills of the Andes going into the Amazon are the most diverse in the world,” Jiggins, at the University of Cambridge, said. “It’s all heavily endangered and while there are still big tracts protected by those countries, they’re still under threat from the usual suspects.” “Documenting this diversity is so important,” he added, “and we can’t make an argument for protecting it if we don’t know what’s there.” David Hodari is a London-based editor."
"The moon may be more than 100 million years older than previously thought, study finds","The moon may be more than 100 million years older than some scientists previously thought, according to a new study. The research, published Wednesday in thejournal Nature, challenges the longstanding ideathat themoon formedroughly 4.35 billion years ago, after a Mars-sized object smashed into the early Earth and created our natural satellite. That timeline is based on analyses of lunar rock samples from NASA’s Apollo missions. But the new study suggests that the moon formed earlier — around 4.51 billion years ago — and then experienced a dramatic “re-melting” event at the time other scientists had assumed it first formed. The melting occurred as the moon was moving away from the Earth, the authors say, when the planet’s constant gravitational tugs warped the moon in a way that caused it to super-heat. The process altered the lunar surface and thus hid the moon’s real age, according to the study. Francis Nimmo, the study’s lead author and a professor in the Earth & Planetary Sciences Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said the extreme heating likely re-melted the moon’s surface, effectively “resetting all the clocks” in lunar rocks. “So the moon rocks are not telling us when the moon formed, but they are telling us when a later event happened that heated the moon,” he said. Within the scientific community, there have been disagreements about the moon’s precise age for decades; Nimmo and his colleagues are not the first to put forward an older estimate. The new findings add to a growing consensus that there may be more to the moon’s history than what the Apollo samples revealed. Planetary scientists have, for instance, struggled to explain how a major collision created the moon 4.35 billion years ago, at a time in the solar system’s history when most large celestial objects were thought to have already clumped together to form planets. “The people who studied the Apollo samples had their reasonable guess for the age of the moon, but people who model how planets in the solar system formed always found it hard to explain how there was still so much big stuff flying around 200 million years after the solar system formed,” Nimmo said. “That has been the state of affairs, with two camps wanting different ages.” The adjusted timeline from Nimmo’s team may also help explain whyminerals on the moon called zircon — whichwere found inApollo moon rocks— were estimated to be roughly 4.5 billion years old. Lunar zircon, like other minerals on the moon, was thought to have crystallized  from extreme temperatures when the moon was created, but its much older age has long confounded scientists. In the new study, Nimmo and his colleagues suggest that the super-heating of the moon was the product of a process known as “tidal heating.” “As the moon gets pushed away, there are particular points where the orbit can temporarily go haywire,” Nimmo said. “During that time, the moon can get squeezed and stretched by Earth’s gravity, and that causes it to heat up.” Similar tidal heating is thought to occur between Jupiter and its moons. A2020 studyfound that the gas giant’s gravity may stretch and squeeze some of its icy moons enough to heat their interiors or even melt rock into magma. That's thought to be the case with the Jovian moon Io. Recent and upcoming lunar missions could provide betterinsights into the moon’s evolutionary history, according to Nimmo. That includes China’s Chang’e 6 mission, which collected samples from the far side of the moon, and NASA’s planned Artemis moon missions. Carsten Münker, a scientist at the Institute of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Cologne who was not involved with the study, said tidal heating is a plausible way to satisfy disagreements over the timing of the moon’s formation. Münker’s own research has focused on dating lunar minerals as a way to narrow down the moon’s precise age. The new study, he said, ""was written by people who were long in the camp that the moon was younger, but now all three [authors] agree with an older lunar age.” “This certainly moves our understanding closer,” Münker said. Although the difference between 4.35 billion years and 4.51 billion years may seem relatively small when it comes to timescales in the universe, nailing down what occurred in those chaotic early days of the solar system is key to understanding how the planets in our celestial neighborhood came to be. “The evolution of the solar system was quite rapid. Within just a few tens of millions of years, the whole array of celestial bodies as we know them today was formed,” Münker said. “That’s why we need a really good time resolution of these very early events, and that’s why it’s important to understand how the Earth-moon system formed.” Denise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News."
Complete mastodon jaw fossil found in New York backyard,"A historic (or perhaps more accurately, prehistoric) discovery was made just under the surface ofa New York homeowner’s lawn. A complete mastodon jaw was found in the backyard of a home in theOrange County townof Scotchtown, according to state officials. The jaw, along with additional bone fragments, was recovered by researchers from the New York State Museum and SUNY Orange, the state Education Department said in a press release Tuesday. It was the first find of its kind in New York in more than 11 years, the officials said. The mastodon jaw, which was believed to be from an adult, was unearthed by researchers after the homeowner spotted it coming out from his lawn. The homeowner initially found two teeth hidden by a plant on the property, and after digging just a few inches underneath that, two more teeth were found. “When I found the teeth and examined them in my hands, I knew they were something special and decided to call in the experts,” the homeowner said. Staff from the museum and university led excavation efforts after that, and uncovered the well-preserved jaw of the mastodon — an ancient relative of modern elephants. A piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment were found as well, officials said. “While the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,” said Dr. Cory Harris, Chair of SUNY Orange’s Behavioral Sciences Department. “We are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.” The fossils will undergo carbon dating and analysis in order to determine just how long ago the mammal was roaming the area, what the diet consisted of, and details of its habitat, according to officials, who noted that the discovery will be featured in public programming starting in 2025. “This discovery is a testament to the rich paleontological history of New York and the ongoing efforts to understand its past,” said Dr. Robert Feranec, director of Research & Collections and curator of Ice Age Animals at the New York State Museum. “This mastodon jaw provides a unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.” About 150 mastodon fossils have been found to date across New York, about a third of which found in Orange County."
White House starts scrapping pending regulations on transgender athletes and student debt,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is abandoning his efforts to provide some protections for transgender student athletes and cancel student loans for more than 38 million Americans, the first steps in an administration-wide plan to jettison pending regulations to prevent President-elect Donald Trump from retooling them to achieve his own aims. The White House expects to pull back unfinished rules across several agencies if there isn’t enough time to finalize them before Trump takes office. If the proposed regulations were left in their current state, the next administration would be able to rewrite them and advance its agenda more quickly. Even as the Biden administration moves to pull back the rules, it pushed ahead with cancellation through other avenues on Friday. The Education Department said it was clearing loans for another 55,000 borrowers who reached eligibility through a program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was created by Congress in 2007 and expanded by the Biden administration. As the pending Biden regulations are withdrawn, nothing prevents Trump from pursuing his own regulations on the same issues when he returns to the White House, but he would have to start from scratch in a process that can take months or even years. “This isn’t the way I wanted it to end,” said Melissa Byrne, an activist who has pushed for student debt cancellation. “Unfortunately, this is the most prudent action to take right now.” She blamed Republicans for putting the Biden administration in this position. “It’s a bummer that we have a GOP that is committed to keeping working-class Americans in debt,” Byrne said. The withdrawals are beginning as Washington braces for a potential government shutdown that could further complicate efforts by the Biden administration to tie up loose ends. In documents withdrawing the student loan proposals, the Education Department insisted it has the authority to cancel the debt but sought to focus on other priorities in the administration’s final weeks. It said the administration would focus on helping borrowers get back on track with payments following the coronavirus pandemic, when payments were paused. “The department at this time intends to commit its limited operational resources to helping at-risk borrowers return to repayment successfully,” the agency wrote. For the regulation on transgender students, the department said it was withdrawing the proposal because of ongoing litigation over how Title IX, the landmark law preventing sex discrimination, should handle issues of gender identity. In addition, the department said there were 150,000 public comments with a range of feedback, including suggestions for modifications that needed to be considered. At this point, the department wrote, “We do not intend for a final rule to be issued.” Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, accused the White House of “adding more red tape and making it more difficult for him to govern.” “President Trump will not be deterred by their dirty tricks and will use every lever of power to reverse the damage Biden has done and implement his America First agenda,” Leavitt said. Kate Shaw, who served in the White House counsel’s office under President Barack Obama, said it’s not unusual for administrations to speed up or slow down rulemaking. It’s more typical, she said, for the federal government to race to finalize regulations during a transition period, but that can be difficult when there’s a time crunch. “If you haven’t started it early enough, you’re not going to be able to wrap it up,” she said. An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the administration still supports the goals of its regulatory proposals. However, the process can be lengthy because it requires legal reviews and collecting input from the public. Federal agencies are now analyzing which rules to finish and which to pull back before the end of Biden’s term, the official said. In recent years, presidents have tended to rely more on executive orders and federal regulations to sidestep gridlock in Congress. However, the rulemaking process can be less durable than legislation, leaving policies more vulnerable to shifts between administrations. There are dozens of other pending regulations across the Education Department and other agencies, ranging from relatively trivial updates to sweeping policies that carry weighty implications for the nation’s schools and businesses. If a rule has already gone through a public feedback process under Biden, Trump could simply replace it with his own proposal and move straight to enacting the policy, effectively bypassing the comment period. The pair of student loan proposals expected to be withdrawn Friday represented Biden’s second attempt at widespread debt cancellation after the Supreme Court rejected his first plan. One of them is a proposal from April that would have provided targeted debt relief to 30 million Americans. It laid out several categories of borrowers eligible for relief. Borrowers who saw their balances balloon because of interest would have had their accrued interest wiped away. Those who had been repaying loans for 20 years or more would have gotten their loans erased. That proposal was halted by a federal judge in September after Republican-led states sued, and it remains tangled in a legal battle. The second rule being withdrawn is a proposal from October that would have allowed the Education Department to cancel loans for people facing various kinds of hardship, including those struggling with steep medical bills or child care costs. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Biden never had the authority to accomplish these plans. “With today’s latest withdrawal, they are admitting these schemes were nothing more than a dishonest attempt to buy votes by transferring debt onto taxpayers who never went to college or worked to pay off their loans,” he said in a statement. Although Biden did not achieve the sweeping loan cancellations that he initially promised, his administration has forgiven an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs. “Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt,” Biden said in a statement. On Friday, officials announced they were erasing debt for another 55,000 workers — including teachers, nurses and law enforcement officials — through Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The program promises to cancel loans for borrowers who spend 10 years in government or nonprofit jobs. The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before Biden leaves office in January. Biden’s rule on transgender sports was proposed in 2023 but was delayed multiple times. It was supposed to be a follow-up to his broader rule that extended civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students under Title IX. The sports rule would have prevented schools from banning transgender athletes outright while allowing limits for certain reasons — for example, if it was a matter of “fairness” in competition or to reduce injury risks. Biden’s proposal left both sides of the issue asking for more. Advocates for transgender athletes said it didn’t go far enough in protecting transgender students from school policies that could unfairly exclude them. Opponents said it fell short of protecting girls and ensuring fairness. The regulation sat on the back burner through the presidential campaign as the issue became a subject of Republican outrage. Trump campaigned on a promise to ban transgender athletes, with a promise to “keep men out of women’s sports.” Had Biden’s proposal been finalized, it was certain to face legal challenges from conservatives who said Biden overstepped his authority. Biden’s broader policy on Title IX, which was finalized in April, faced a barrage of legal challenges that prevented it from taking effect in 26 states."
NYC man plans epic proposal for boyfriend at Rockefeller Center ice rink,"A New York City man organized a fairytale proposal for his boyfriend that temporarily cleared the famous ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center. Craig Buchholz and Sebastian West had one of their first dates at the rink a few years ago. They went back on Thursday, and this time Buchholz worked with Chase Freedom, the sponsor of the ring, to clear the rink so he could propose to West,NBC New York reported. When the time came, West initially went to skate off the ice with everyone else when someone said the rink had to be cleared for cleaning. Then Buchholz got down on one knee and pulled out a small box with two rings, one for each of them. West said the Rockefeller Center rink was the first place he went ice skating, “so now it’s great to be back a few years later and now engaged, and I have Craig to thank for both of those occasions,” he told NBC New York. Buchholz added, “I was actually just exhilarated, and time was going so slow, so I just wanted to get to the clear-the-ice moment.” West and Buchholz celebrated afterward with champagne next to the rink. Tishman Speyer, a real estate company that co-owns Rockefeller Center, told NBC New York that there are about 100 proposals per season at the rink. The Rink at Rockefeller Center hasa webpagededicated to engagement requests, which include selections for the exact time of the special moment as well as a specific song a couple would like to have played during and after the proposal. It’s unclear exactly how much a private proposal on the ice costs.Tickets for one hour of skatingvary from $11 to $114 per person depending on the date and time of day. One mantold People magazine earlier this monththat he saved up $1,650 for a private five-minute proposal at the rink. Jo Yurcaba is a reporter for NBC Out."
"UCLA student sues California doctors, says she was 'fast-tracked' into transgender surgery","A UCLA student is suing multiple California health care providers and hospitals for medical negligence, alleging she was wrongly diagnosed with gender dysphoria and then “fast-tracked onto the conveyor belt of irreversibly damaging” puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery, according to her lawsuit. Kaya Clementine Breen, 20, said she experienced sexual abuse as a young child, and by the time she was 11, she “beganstruggling with the thought of developing into a woman and began to believe that life would be easier if she were a boy,” according to her suit filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. When she expressed this to her then-school counselor, the counselor told her “that she was transgender and called her parents to tell them the same.” Breen, who was also suffering from anxiety, depression and undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit, was then taken by her parents to the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, where she said she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria — the distress one can experience when their gender identity and birth sex are in conflict — and began to receive transition-related care at 12 years old. “This case is about a team of purported health care providers who collectively decided that a vulnerable girl struggling with complex mental health struggles and suffering from multiple instances of sexual abuse should be prescribed a series of life-altering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, ultimately, receive a double mastectomy at the age of 14,” Breen’s lawsuit states. Breen began receiving puberty-suppressing medication at 12, was prescribed cross-sex hormones from 13 to 19 and underwent a double mastectomy at 14, according to court documents, which stated that her “her mental health progressively declined” following these treatments. In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Breen said, “In retrospect, I wish that somebody had suggested real, genuine therapy first, instead of gender-specific therapy, because really the only therapy that I received until much later was specifically focused on gender dysphoria, and didn’t connect my gender dysphoria to anything else.” Breen said she began to question her decision to transition after she starteddialectical behavior therapy, a type of talk therapy that seeks to help those struggling with intense emotions, earlier this year. “I sort of started questioning my own gender identity and if I was doing this for the right reasons,” she said. The defendants in Breen’s lawsuit include Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, an adolescent medicine physician specializing in gender-affirming care; Children’s Hospital Los Angeles; Dr. Scott Mosser, a plastic surgeon specializing in gender-affirming surgery; the Gender Confirmation Center of San Francisco; UCSF Health Community Hospitals; and psychotherapist Susan P. Landon. When asked to comment on the lawsuit, a spokesperson said the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, where Olson-Kennedy works, has “provided high quality, age-appropriate, medically necessary care for more than 30 years.” “Treatment is patient- and family-centered, following guidelines from professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and Endocrine Society. We do not comment on pending litigation; and out of respect for patient privacy and in compliance with state and federal laws, we do not comment on specific patients and/or their treatment,” the spokesperson said in an email, adding that “Dr. Olson-Kennedy is unavailable for comment.” In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the Gender Confirmation Center in San Francisco, where Mosser works, said there’s “no such thing as a rubber stamp patient interaction” at their health facility. “As healthcare providers, and in compliance with HIPAA considerations, we are unable to comment on specific protected health information or pending litigation,” the spokesperson added in their email, which also included a link to a statement from Mosser. Mosser’sstatement, which appears to have been posted to the Gender Confirmation Center’s website last week, applauded the center as being “at the forefront of gender-affirming surgery, with the wellbeing of our patients as our highest priority.” “Our robust processes and protocols are designed to ensure that patients navigating our services fully understand the implications of the gender-affirming procedures they may choose to undergo as part of their transition,” Mosser stated. “We regularly hear from former patients sharing updates about the overwhelmingly positive impact these surgeries have had on their lives — messages that continue to arrive many years after their procedures.” UCSF Health Community Hospitals, which is named in the lawsuit, told NBC News that Saint Francis Memorial Hospital, where Breen was a patient in 2019, was not acquired by UCSF until August of this year. It had no further comment. Landon did not respond to a request for comment. Breen said she doesn’t believe the individual health providers named in her lawsuit “intentionally acted in poor faith,” but she alleged they were dismissive of her pre-existing mental health issues. When asked what she hopes to get from this lawsuit, Breen said she wants “some semblance of justice or change.” While she is seeking “financial reimbursement for the amount that this has cost me and my family,” she said, she most of all wants to “help dismantle the rumor that no one is ever fast-tracked into gender treatments.” Along listof major U.S. medical associations — including theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, theAmerican Medical Associationand theAmerican Psychiatric Association— support transgender minors having access to transition-related care, like puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and have denounced state laws restricting such care. “There is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving,”Dr. Moira Szilagyi wroteon the American Academy of Pediatrics website in August 2022, when she was the organization’s president. “The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.” Gender-affirming care for minors can look different depending on the child’s age and circumstances. For young children, caremay involve a new name or pronoun as opposed to physical changes. At the onset of puberty, children may begin puberty blockers to inhibit them from developing secondary sex characteristics like breasts or facial hair. Hormone therapy may come next, which would allow the teenager to physically develop into the gender matching their identity. Surgical gender-affirming care is rarely performed on minors, and these procedures are illegal in dozens of states, though California is not among them. Over the past few years, there have been severallawsuitsfiled in the U.S. and the U.K. by “detransitioners,” or those who transitioned genders and then transitioned back to their birth sex. A 21-year-old New York woman who had detransitionedsued Planned Parenthoodand several individual health care providers in April claiming medical malpractice and a lack of informed consent, alleging the defendants rushed her into undergoing gender-affirming care when she was 18. Research suggests that regretting treatment for gender dysphoria is “extremely rare,” according to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH. Asurvey conducted in 2015by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 8% of respondents detransitioned at some point in their life, with 62% of that grouponly detransitioning temporarily. Transition-related care for minors has been a divisive political issue, with Republicans in 26 states passing measures to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors in recent years, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. TheSupreme Courtis currently weighing a case challenging Tennessee’s ban on such care. The politics surrounding gender-affirming care for minors were also reportedly behind a decision by Olson-Kennedy, one of the defendants in Breen’s lawsuit, to delay publication of a study she conducted on the effects of puberty blockers. Olson-Kennedy told The New York Times in anarticle published in Octoberthat she didn’t publish the results, which found the medication did not improve the mental health of minors with gender dysphoria, because she feared the findings might fuel the types of political attacks that led to state bans on gender-affirming care.

Philadelphia City Council approves $1.3 billion 76ers Center City arena plan,"PHILADELPHIA — The future of Philadelphia’s Market East community in Center City is now crystal clear as City Council has voted to approve a$1.3 billion plan to bring a brand new arena for the Philadelphia Sixersto the neighborhood. During its scheduled meeting on Thursday, Dec. 19, City Council voted, with a majority of members in support on the legislative package that would make way for a plan that could have a transformative effect on the area. The approval occurred after months of negotiations with developers and meetings with members of the community in every corner of the city as well asprotestsandoutburstsfrom those on both sides of the debate. At the start of Thursday’s hearing, there was no shortage of protest as a group of individuals opposed to the arena plan stood arm-in-arm, chanting and blowing whistles while on the floor of City Council’s chambers in City Hall. Wearing shirts that read “City Council sold out Philly” and “shut it down,” protestors sat in a group on the floor of city council as the meeting was intended to start at 10 a.m. Around 10:15 a.m., several protestors were taken out of the room by law enforcement officials. By about 10:25 a.m., the protestors on the floor of chambers had been removed, yet the crowd in attendance throughout the room continued to chant. For some time, as City Council President Kenyatta Johnson attempted to start the meeting, chants of “shame” filled the chambers. The meeting was eventually brought to order by about 10:35 a.m., though some commotion persisted. In opening the meeting, Johnson addressed the crowd, calling for those in attendance to respect the process as council has had eight hearings solely dedicated to the arena plan. “All we are asking is just respect our process and let us continue our business,” said Johnson at the top of the morning’s meeting. Public comment — which included an “extremely long list” of speakers, according to Johnson — opened with input from those on both sides of the issue. Several individuals spoke positively on the economic impact and influx of jobs the arena could provide, saying the project would benefit the city. “We want to make sure that this arena is built,” Daisy Cruz of the service workers union 32BJ SEIU said. ‘Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for building the arena.” Paul Brown, who said he was a school psychologist in the city’s Roxborough community, said that council should have fought for more money for the school district in the agreement with arena developers. “You are in a prime opportunity right now to demand something better, that doesn’t displace people, that doesn’t harm people, but you just want to rush through a deal that gives them less,” he said. Each of the 11 pieces of legislation needed its own vote. And the majority of these bills passed with a vote of 12 to 5. The councilmembers that opposed nearly every bill in this package were: Jamie Gauthier (D-3rd dist.), Rue Landau (D-At-Large), Jeffery Young (D-5th dist.), Kendra Brooks (Working Families Party, At-Large) and Nicolas V. O’Rourke (Working Families Party — At Large). Yet, a few of the bills were supported by more members of council. For example, one bill that would create an overlay for the Chinatown neighborhood passed 14-3. Other bills up for a vote passed unanimously. The proposal would bring an arena to the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets. Ahead of the day’s vote, City Councilmember Mark Squilla (D-1st dist.) said that, even after the day’s voting, City Council will continue to meet with stakeholders and members of the community to ensure neighbors are part of the development process. “This is not the end of the process,” Squilla said. City Council has been holding meetings since September focused solely on the arena plan. And there have been some sticking points. The biggest just might be how much money the developers plan to include in a Community Benefits Agreement with the neighborhoods nearest the project site. Initially, developers proposed $50 million in that agreement, but some suggested that figure be doubled. In fact, some members of groups that opposed the development planhad sought to have that figure upped to $300 million. But, in legislation that was read before City Council forits first reading last week, the proposal was amended to request $60 million in that CBA. In breaking down how this $60 million in CBA funding could be used in the community, amendments note that $33 million would be set aside for initiatives in and around the city’s Chinatown neighborhood — like developing a master plan for the community and providing $2 million in grants for small businesses. The remaining $27 million would then be spread to other initiatives citywide, including $7 million for extended day/extended year schooling and $3 million for public transit at the arena. With City Council’s support on Thursday, construction is expected to begin sometime in 2028. Developers hope to open the arena in 2031. Hayden Mitman is a reporter for NBC Philadelphia."
New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim reveals a surprise in his Senate floor desk,"Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., found a surprise in a Senate floor desk drawer shortly after being sworn in as the state’s first Asian American senator. He found that he was sitting at a desk etched with the name of an Asian American trailblazer: Daniel K. Inouye, a former senator who became the firstJapanese American electedto Congress. Inouye became Hawaii’s first congressman after it became a state, and served in the army during World War II — enlisting shortly after the strike on Pearl Harbor. “I learned Senate floor desks have drawers where every Senator who used that desk carves their name,” Kim wrote in a post on X on Wednesday. “I just pulled out my drawer. 1 name jumped out.” Inouye died in 2012 at the age of 88. After he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he became thefirst and onlyU.S. senator to be the recipient of both the Medal of Freedom and the Medal of Honor. “WWII Medal of Honor. Senator for ~ 50 yrs. AAPI trailblazer,” Kim wrote of Inouye. Inouye was the second-longest serving senator, representing Hawaii for 49 years. Hawaii’s largest airport was renamed after the Honolulu native in 2017, according to Hawaii’s Transportation Department. Kim, the first Korean American senator, represented New Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District before defeating Republican Curtis Bashaw to win the seat of former Sen. Bob Menendez. Asian Americans are thefastest growingracial group in the state, with the number of their voters surging 99% from 2000 to 2022. “I cannot believe I get to sit at the desk of a hero of mine,” Kim said.

Undocumented Chinese men say they're baffled by Trump's reported plans to deport them first,"LOS ANGELES — Kevin Yang, a 46-year-old undocumented immigrant from China, said he once felt a sense of indebtedness toward the United States. But now, with President-elect Donald Trump’s second term on the horizon, he feels worried and on edge. “The gratitude I once felt toward the U.S for accepting me into the country … has now shifted to anxiety and fear, Yang said. “And I know others in my situation feel the same.” With the incoming Trump administration looking toprioritize deporting Chinese nationals, citing national security concerns, many undocumented Chinese men say they couldn’t feel further afield from the reasoning behind the potential policy — that Trump thinks they’re assembling an army within the United States. Several Chinese undocumented migrants who made the trek across the southern border to the United States spoke about Trump’s mass deportation plans. Sources close to the Trump campaign hadexclusively toldNBC News that undocumented Chinese immigrants who are deemed to be of military age will be among the first groups targeted. But, having fled their homeland because of political persecution, or uprooted their lives for better economic opportunities, many undocumented Chinese men reject the notion of being a threat to the United States as absurd. “We’re not military spies. Do you see anyone buying heavy weaponry or weapons here?” Yang said. “The fact that Trump says this is completely crazy.” Trump’s transition team did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. If indeed focused on immigrants of Chinese descent, Trump’s deportation policies are likely to be challenged legally as a blatant example of racial profiling. But experts note that, after having attempted versions of these policies in his first term, and emboldened by growing support among the public, Trump could be more successful implementing them this time around. “I expect that we will see ICE raids that are carried out for the purpose of terrorizing immigrant communities and where the purpose is inflicting cruelty on immigrants,” Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told NBC News. While Asian immigrants have long been the fastest-growing undocumented population, the number ofChinese nationals crossing into the United Statesin particular has skyrocketed in recent years. Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, the number of undocumented Chinese nationals crossing both the northern and southern borders has tripled, from just over 27,000 to more than 78,000. Experts and undocumented immigrants have said that China’s economic downturn and political friction, which came to a head during the country’s prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions, were largely the basis of the migration wave. But Trump has repeatedly suggested that “military-age” men are conspiring to build an army. “They’re coming in from China — 31, 32,000 over the last few months — and they’re all military age and they mostly are men,” Trump said in April during a campaign rally. “And it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a little army in our country? Is that what they’re trying to do?” And on a Dr. Phil podcast episode released in early December, Trump’s incoming “border czar” doubled down on such comments. “Sixty thousand Chinese males, mostly military age, do not leave China without the coordination and approval of the Chinese government,” said Tom Homan, who was the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term in office. “This is a coordinated national security vulnerability that the Chinese government is involved in.” Bin Wei, a 50-year-old who immigrated with his teenage son, came to the United States by way of the Darien Gap, a land bridge filled with dense jungle connecting Central and South America. He said that immigrants like himself only make the dangerous trek so that they can establish more stability for their families — “not for any kind of military or violent reasons.” “We left a hard and oppressed life — harder than many people in the U.S. can imagine,” Wei said of being painted as an adversary. “All we want is freedom to make life better for us and our kids.” With Trump’s campaign promises casting uncertainty over his future, Wei said he’s been acting in accordance with the Chinese motto, “follow the correct and law-abiding path.” And he’s also been recommended to remain in California, a sanctuary state in which no state and local resources can be used to aid federal immigration enforcement. “Chinese language media is telling us all to watch ourselves, to do everything by the book and the law, because Trump will find any excuse to deport us,” he said. But Wei, who currently lives in Southern California, said he’s most worried about his son. Trump’s policies, Wei worries, could have long-term, far-reaching effects on the teen’s life. “He’s the entire reason why we came to the U.S.,” Wei said. “To think about any kind of diminishing future for him makes me really sad and angry.” Yang, who made the journey across the border in 2022, said he was a city representative back in China and fled after clashes with the Chinese government led to his political persecution. He said he traveled into the United States by foot through a remote, barren area of the desert, weathering severe dehydration before being picked up by Border Patrol agents. Trump’s election has left him “deeply saddened and helpless,” he said. Yang said much of the president-elect’s campaign promises smack of the political leadership that he fled from. “Their proposed policies such as establishing large-scale detention camps for illegal immigrants and deploying the military to deport immigrants is disturbingly similar to the methods used by dictators like Xi Jinping,” Yang said. Yang added that the “disregard for any kind of laws or regulations” from the Trump administration also feels similar to the authoritarian regime in China. Trump’s targeting of Chinese immigrants is likely to face legal pushback, including accusations of racial profiling, especially if Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids ramp up as they did in his first term, Mukherjee told NBC News. “Simply from looking at a person, it is impossible to know if they are a U.S. citizen or not,” said Mukherjee, the clinic director at Columbia Law School. “As ICE agents carry out raids, they will sweep a large number of people into their drag net, including those with lawful status in the United States.” Early in his first term, Trump escalated the number of workplace raids, targeting a string ofAsian restaurants in central Mississippi, for example, among many other sites. This time around, Trump has been looking to broaden the types of places ICE agents can sweep, with several sourcesexclusively telling NBC Newsthat he intends to rescind a policy that prevents these agents from arresting immigrants in houses of worship and schools among other “sensitive” areas without approval from supervisors. “I don’t say this to be alarmist,” Mukherjee said, urging undocumented immigrants to apply for immigration relief and learn their rights. “I just think that people need to be prepared.” Mukherjee said that people should take precautions to avoid arrest and detention, including refusing to open the door to any strangers unless they show a judicial search warrant. And if an immigration officer or law enforcement approaches them in a public location, she said, undocumented immigrants still have the right to remain silent. “You don’t need to say where you were born. You don’t need to answer when you entered the country. You should try to stay calm,” she said. “You shouldn’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first and reviewing the paperwork with a lawyer.” Los Angeles-based attorney Frank Hwu, who’s represented thousands of Chinese undocumented immigrants, also noted that while Chinese undocumented immigrants who have immigration relief secured or pending are unable to be deported without their day in court, they can still be detained. And this has made some of his clients now fearful of checking in with ICE, an otherwise routine, regular appointment that most have complied with since entering the United States. “You don’t want to be detained while you’re waiting for court, because the court process takes years,” Hwu said, adding that he had a client who was detained for six months. “They’re here with their children, with their moms and grandmas.” The potential of being repatriated has left many undocumented immigrants anxious about returning to China. Hwu said many of his clients aren’t fearful of going back to difficult life conditions as much as they are of the unknown consequences of their illegal immigration. On most days, Wei says he doesn’t even allow his mind to go there. “Speaking for myself, I am very afraid of going back to China,” Wei said. “There is no doubt that the government will not be happy with me, and that I will be punished severely.” China has not been so open to accepting repatriated immigrants in the past. But the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement to NBC News that the country will be cooperating with efforts to repatriate undocumented immigrants, accepting repatriated individuals who are confirmed to be Chinese citizens through their verification process. “As a matter of principle, the Chinese government firmly opposes all forms of illegal immigration and has engaged in practical cooperation with immigration enforcement agencies of relevant countries, including the United States, achieving positive results,” the country’s foreign ministry said. And in December, the Department of Homeland Security conducted its fourth large charter removal flight in less than six months to China. Along with prioritizing the deportation of military-age Chinese immigrants, Trump has promised toend birthright citizenship, stripping rights from those born in the country to undocumented parents. The Trump transition team is also compiling a list of countries, including Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas, to which it may deport migrants whose home countries refuse to accept them. Ultimately, Yang said, Trump has gotten it all wrong. “The Chinese people that I encountered crossing illegally into the United States have a simple purpose: To find a place where they can survive,” Yang said.

Celebrity pastor plagued by Diddy misinformation on YouTube asks court to intervene,"A lawyer representing Bishop T.D. Jakes, the celebrity pastor, is going to new lengths to try to combat artificial intelligence-generated misinformationposted about his client on YouTube, saying the platform has failed to effectively uphold its own policies. On Thursday, Dustin Pusch, an attorney for Jakes, filed a motion in the Northern District of California seeking to subpoena Google, YouTube’s parent company, to share information concerning the identities of four YouTube account holders. They are purportedly located in Pakistan, South Africa, the Philippines and Kenya, according to the accounts’ “About” sections on YouTube. The motion said these accounts made false claims about Jakes, citingprevious NBC News reportingabout AI-generated misinformation on YouTube, and added that elements of the videos were likely created with AI tools, including images used in thumbnails and voice-overs. YouTube videos utilizing AI have been popular for years, and YouTuberecently introducedAI initiatives to dramatically increase the amount of AI-generated content and material on the platform. But AI elements have also been used tospread misinformationon videos that have the potential to make a large profit for both YouTube and their creators, by monetizing them with ads. The motion filed by Jakes’ lawyer is a significant development in efforts to combat viral AI-generated misinformation on the platform, being one of the first of its kind attempting to unmask the creators behind it. Inprevious reporting, a YouTube creator behind similar content previously confirmed their use of AI tools to NBC News, and AI detection experts found a high likelihood of similar content involving AI-generated images and audio. YouTube didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In the last year, Jakes has been the subject of hundreds of YouTube videos that have received millions of views, part of a torrent of misinformation that stemmed from speculation surrounding allegations made about Sean “Diddy” Combs, with whom Jakes has been associated in the past. Since Combs was first accused of abuse — in a lawsuit he settled with Casandra “Cassie” Ventura in November 2023 — a flurry of allegations, includingsex trafficking, have been made against the rapper and record executive, whowas arrestedin September and is awaiting trial while in custody. An attorney for Combs denied Ventura’s allegations andsaid thatthe settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. Combs has denied other allegations made in subsequent civil lawsuits andpleaded not guiltyin the criminal case. Alongside the real news coverage of the Combs case, an online misinformation ecosystemtargeting Black celebritieshas flourished. In January, NBC News identified dozens of videos with hundreds of thousands of views containing AI-generated misinformation about Combs, Jakes and people like TV host Steve Harvey and actor Denzel Washington. Some of the videos falsely reported the individuals being arrested and others featured thumbnails with salacious fake images of celebrities in bed together. NBC News found that some of the videos were createdusing AI tools. YouTube took action on some of the videos and channels NBC News identified. But Jakes’ attorney wrote in his motion that YouTube has failed to take action on many of the videos he’s flagged for the company. Jakes is the senior pastor at the non-denominational Christian megachurch The Potter’s House in Dallas. Since 2021, he hosts a sermon series on Revolt, a media company Combs started in 2013; the rapper stepped down from Revolt last year, selling his stake in March. In 2022, Jakes made a brief stop at Combs’ birthday party. In a 2024 lawsuit, music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones alleged that Combs planned to “leverage his relationship” with Jakes to “soften the impact” of Ventura’s lawsuit. Combs has not addressed the claim. Jakes has not defended Combs in the wake of Ventura’s lawsuit, but he has defended himself from an avalanche of “false and absurd videos” about him, Combs and other Black celebrities, the motion said. “These YouTubers are purportedly using the sordid and sensational allegations revolving around Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs to attack, humiliate, degrade, and defame Bishop Jakes—and many other prominent black celebrities—with manufactured claims that he is guilty of the same crimes and other lewd and repulsive conduct as Mr. Combs,” the motion said. “In other words, YouTubers are using Bishop Jakes’s prominence as clickbait to attract unwitting users to view their knowingly false videos for their (and possibly other foreign companies’) financial gain.” As described in the motion and in screenshots of YouTube video titles and thumbnails viewed by NBC News, fake images show Jakes in a prison jumpsuit, in handcuffs and in sexual scenarios with other male celebrities. Video titles falsely claim that Jakes was arrested, came out as gay and stepped down from his position at The Potter’s House. The motion said Jakes’ legal action follows a yearlong attempt to engage with YouTube’s legal counsel on the issue, as well as report videos that violate YouTube’s community guidelines around misleading thumbnails, spam, misinformation and lewd sexual imagery. YouTube has removed some of the videos, but left a majority up, the motion said. An NBC News review of YouTube search results for “td jakes” and “td jakes diddy” on Wednesday surfaced more than two dozen videos, some with over 1 million views, with titles and thumbnails containing false information, doctored photos and lurid claims about Jakes. Some of the videos connected Combs to Jakes’ recentonstage health incident. If the motion and subpoena are successful, upon receiving information like IP addresses and email addresses, Jakes may pursue defamation litigation against the people behind the YouTube channels, the motion said. In November, Jakes fileda defamation suitagainst a man who claimed Jakes sexually assaulted him. The man made the claim on a podcast and no charges were ever filed.

Megan, 29, whose real name is Megan Pete, filed a request Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The petition says Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, has ""traumatized"" Megan since 2020 and ""shows no signs of stopping."" ""Mr. Peterson is a violent and dangerous criminal, and his established pattern of behavior demonstrates the reasons this civil harassment restraining order is necessary to protect Ms. Pete and her wellbeing,"" it says. Lanez, 32, is housed at the California Correctional Institution in Southern California after he wasconvicted and sentencedto 10 years forshooting Megan in the feet on July 10, 2020. He has appealed his conviction. ""Even from behind bars, Mr. Peterson continues to terrorize Ms. Pete,"" the petition says. The nonprofit organization representing Lanez accused Megan of lying.

Michael Vick hired as head coach at Norfolk State,"Michael Vick, one of the most electrifying quarterbacks in NFL history, will become the next head coach at Norfolk State University, according to multiple reports Tuesday. He will take over for Dawson Odums, who was fired on Nov. 26 after a 15-31 record in four seasons. Vick, 44, who has no formal coaching experience,told The Virginian-Pilotnewspaperthis week, ""I know how to lead and I know what it takes."" He has been an NFL analyst for Fox Sports since 2017. A Newport News, Virginia, native, Vick starred at Virginia Tech and led the Hokies to the BCS National Championship Game in 2000, losing to Florida State. He finished sixth in voting for the Heisman Trophy that year and was drafted No. 1 overall in 2001 by the Atlanta Falcons. Vick played 13 NFL seasons, including six with the Falcons and five with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was named a Pro Bowler four times and threw for 22,464 yards and 133 touchdowns in his career. But while he was a top-tier passer, he was most known for his ability to run. His 6,109 yards is No. 1 in NFL history for quarterbacks, and he ranks No. 8 in touchdowns on the ground, with 36. In 2008 he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. Vick is recognized as having helped revolutionize the position and has been cited numerous times for inspiring dual-threat quarterbacks in recent years. Vick's stardom took a major hit in 2007 when he pleaded guilty to hisinvolvement in a dog fighting ring. He was released by the Falcons and spent 21 months in federal prison. After he served his sentence, the Eagles signed him in 2009. The next season he led Philadelphia to a division title and was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He officially retired in 2016. Vick will be the latest former NFL star to become a head coach at a historically Black college or university. Deion Sanders spent two years at Jackson State, compiling a 27-6 record, before he left for Colorado in 2022. Eddie George just completed his fourth season at Tennessee State and led the Tigers to the FCS postseason. Greg Rosenstein is the sports editor for NBC News Digital."
"Texas mom deported for missed hearing due to emergency C-section, attorney says","A Texas mother says she was unfairly deported to Mexico and forced to depart the U.S. with her four children after missing an immigration court hearing because she was recovering from delivering premature newborn twins by emergency C-section. Infants Ashley and Allison, both of whom are U.S. citizens born in Houston, have been enduring pneumonia and bronchitis, often needing oxygen masks to breathe, since arriving to Mexico,Salazar-Hinojosa told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. “I feel bad, I feel devastated to see my daughters sick,"" she said. According to the family, the chain of events started on Sept. 13, when the twins were born at 35 weeks. ""I had to have an emergency C-section. My babies were born prematurely. I was very ill because of my hemorrhage,” Salazar-Hinojosa said. Salazar-Hinojosa's husband, Federico Arellano, called a phone number given to the family byimmigration servicesto inform them of the situation because the mother was scheduled to appear in immigration court on Oct. 9, according to an affidavit from Arellano shared with NBC News Thursday night. The family was told on the phone that the immigration hearing would be rescheduled, Arellano stated in his affidavit. During a press conference Monday, Arellanotold reporters in Houstonhis wife missed the Oct. 9 hearing because she was told by doctors to recover at home. Arellano, 24, and Salazar-Hinojosa, 23, have been married since 2019. Arellano is a U.S. citizen born in Houston and Salazar-Hinojosa is a Mexican national. In addition to twins Ashley and Allison, the couple also share a 2-year-old son, Federico, born in Mexico. Arellano is also a stepfather to his wife's 7-year-old daughter, Yitzel, also born in Mexico. On Dec. 6, the family received a phone call from immigration authorities and they were told to report to an office in Greenspoint, Texas, four days later to discuss Salazar-Hinojosa's case, according to Arellano's affidavit. Salazar-Hinojosa said she arrived at the appointment with her husband and four children thinking it would be like any other of her previous routine appointments. Instead, immigration authorities arrested Salazar-Hinojosa, and she and her four children were sent to Mexico, according to the family's attorney Isaias Torres. Arellano's affidavit also states that when he asked immigration authorities to let him keep the twins, they responded, ""'NO' that the babies were too young and should stay with their mother."" ""We didn’t have anything with us, no clothes, no diapers, nothing. We didn’t have anything with us,""Salazar-Hinojosa told Noticias Telemundo. ""They didn’t let me make any calls to my family, they took my phone away from me, they snatched it out of my hands."" Arellano tried to intervene on behalf of his family. According to Salazar-Hinojosa, her husband begged immigration authorities to please not take his family away from him. ""He wanted to see if we could get a lawyer to see what we could do, and they said no, that they had to take us now,"" Salazar-Hinojosa said. She added that immigration authorities then insisted she sign the paperwork for her deportation. ""They said that if I didn’t sign the deportation forms and all that, they were going to arrest my husband and fine him,"" Salazar-Hinojosa said, adding that she was afraid they would arrest her husband if she didn't sign; ""they forced me."" After the family realized they could not stop Salazar-Hinojosa's deportation on such short notice, the mother felt she had no other choice but to keep her children with her,telling Noticias Telemundoshe worried that her husband would struggle balancing work and childcare on his own. Immigration officials confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that they had deported Salazar-Hinojosa from Texas. While some media outlets reported that the mother, the twins and the two other childrenhad been deported, Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News that it had only formally deported Salazar-Hinojosa. ""ICE does not deport U.S. citizens. Any decision for minors with U.S. citizenship to depart the U.S. with their parents is up to the parents,” an ICE spokesperson said. ICE alleged Salazar-Hinojosa entered the U.S. illegally on June 28 through the Rio Grande Valley area in Texas. The spokesperson said she was released June 29 under the Alternatives to Detention program, pending her immigration proceedings. The spokesperson said Salazar-Hinojosa failed to show up to the Oct. 9 hearing and was ordered removed by a judge with the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review. DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. Torrestold WOAIthat ""this case shouldn’t have gone to this extreme. There were options, legal options that were available and he was not given that opportunity.” A second attorney representing Arellano and his family, Silvia Mintz,told Noticias Telemundoshe believes ""ICE officers abused their discretion, because Cristina is not a criminal, the children are newborns, and this could have been resolved with a motion to reopen the case."" Both Mintz and Torres told KHOU Arellano tried to explain, but ICE agents prevented him. “They were shocked and surprised that they were separated,” Torres said. The attorneys have said they plan to file a complaint with the Office of Inspector General as well as immigration petitions to see if Salazar-Hinojosa and her children can return to the U.S. under parole. That process could take several months. President Joe Biden has been criticized by Republicans who have said his policies have left the border open to illegal immigration. But in June, the Migration Policy Institute reported that Biden’s deportations wereon track to surpass those of Donald Trump's first administration. Trump was elected in November after vowing to conduct the largest mass deportation operation in American history. His pick to head ICE, Tim Homan, has said that the only way to not break up families under Trump’s plan is to “send them all back.” People born in the United States — with the exception of children of certain foreign diplomats — are constitutionally guaranteed U.S. citizenship regardless of whether their parents are illegally here.Trump recently said in a ""Meet the Press"" exclusive interviewthat he wants to end that guarantee. Ina 2021 report, the Government Accountability Office found that over about five years, ICE arrested 674, detained 121 and removed 70 people that the GAO said were potentially U.S. citizens. The GAO found ICE did not keep sufficient data on U.S. citizen deportations at the time. Nicole Acevedo is a reporter for NBC Latino. Suzanne Gamboa is a reporter for NBC Latino."
The Cuban punk rockers who injected themselves with HIV: 'Los Frikis' tells their story,"A coming-of-age movie with a dramatic punk rock twist has a storyline that may sound unreal, but it's based on true events. In ""Los Frikis,"" set in early 1990s Cuba, hundreds of young, disenfranchised Cubans inject themselves with HIV during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, hoping to escape political repression by going inside government-run clinics, or sanitariums. Based on true events, the film takes its title from the Spanish translation of the word “freaky,” referring to the punk rock movement that came together in Cuba during the 1980s and 1990s. “I grew up in Miami, I have Cuban family, Cuban friends, but I didn’t know this story specifically, so it was very important for me to tell it,” said one of the movie's leads, Puerto Rican Guatemalan actor Adria Arjona. Arjona, who starred earlier this year in the romantic comedy crime movie ""Hit Man"" and is known for her roles in the series ""Andor"" and ""True Detective,"" spoke to NBC News alongside two of the movie's co-stars, Héctor Medina and Eros de la Puente. ""Los Frikis"" was written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of ""The Peanut Butter Falcon,"" the 2019 comedy drama about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from a care facility. During the AIDS crisis, Cuba's sanitariums drew both praise and criticism. While they were credited with containing the spread of HIV on the communist island, the clinicswere described as “a pretty prison”by Dr. Jonathan Mann, the first AIDS director at the World Health Organization. According to an article in The Lancet, Cuba had 927 cases of HIV seropositivity and 187 cases of AIDS as of May 1993. By comparison, neighboring Puerto Rico, with roughly one-third the population of Cuba, had over 8,000 cases of AIDS at the time, and New York City, with a population closer in size to Cuba, had 43,000 patients with AIDS then. But Cuba’s health policy led to ""unintended consequences,""The New York Times wrote in 2012about this period. “To stay out, some Cubans tried to avoid testing. But a few others, usually teenagers estranged from their families, deliberately got themselves infected to get in,” The New York Times reported. Patients were initially confined to the medical center by the military. But life inside, which ultimately inspired “Los Frikis,” could also be less austere than what these punk rockers faced on the streets. “Inmates got food, medical care and their old salaries; theater troupes and art classes formed. Gay men could live together, which was not true in the macho culture outside,” The New York Times reported. “Los Frikis” tells the story of this second young group, who lived in a Cuba that was increasingly isolated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the ensuing demise of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc. Fidel Castro’s revolutionary government cracked down in response to dissidents and others who didn't fit in. “They’ll throw you in jail for anything here. It’s impossible to survive without breaking the law,” Paco (played by Medina), one of the punk rockers in the film, says. Paco, like other young people, believed he could escape from government repression by entering a sanitarium after injecting himself with HIV. Punk bands started forming at these medical centers, and recorded cassettes inspired hundreds to self-inject. But many would soon face a rude awakening as they died of AIDS; it would be years before the current treatments that have made it possible to live with HIV as a manageable condition. Medina — who will play Raúl Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro and the former president of Cuba,in an upcoming movie with Al Pacino— said that he prepared for his role in “Los Frikis” by speaking to a sanitarium doctor who now lives in the U.S. The doctor had worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium about 30 minutes southwest from Havana by car. He told Medina that it was painful to remember, since he had become friends with his patients who later died of AIDS. Medina said much of the punk music that Los Frikis made at the time was not preserved. But viewers could still connect with the very positive message of their culture in the film, which shows how they found freedom in friendship, love and the communities they created at the sanitariums. This message, Arjona said, transforms the “Frikis” from scary outcasts to relatable people who are vulnerable and want to heal from different traumas. In the movie, Arjona’s character, María, tells Gustavo (played by de la Puente) that “you can’t expect to hold onto anything.” Faced with the deaths of her peers, María poetically says that loved ones, sunsets and even cherished animals like horses eventually disappear. This makes de la Puente think about one of the most enduring messages from the Frikis movement. “You don’t need many things to have everything,” he said. “I am referring in the context of the film, and how that group of people becomes a family and creates such a beautiful experience in a moment from the history of Cuba that was very empty.” “Los Frikis” releases in New York and Los Angeles on Friday andselect movie theaters nationwide Dec. 25.

Immigration advocates gear up to fight Trump promises in places that voted for him,"McALLEN, Texas — Inside the brightly lit law offices here of immigration attorney Alex Martinez, the front desk has been buzzing with activity. Positioned on a quiet street corner just 8 miles north of the bridge that separates the U.S. and Mexico, the law firm has seen a notable uptick in phone calls and in-person visits from people looking for an immigration attorney. Here in Hidalgo County, where President-elect Donald Trump won by just under 3 percentage points last month, many of those customers say they or their family members voted for him. Until this year, Hidalgo County hadn’t voted Republican for presidentsince 1972. Now, it’s one of14 countieson or near the  border that voted for Trump — many for the first time in decades as well. “They believe that he is good for business,” Martinez said. “It seems to be more important that they have money coming into the family than them securing a legal status or not being removed.” In the 35 states that a 2022Pew Research Center reportidentified as having undocumented immigrant populations above 50,000, more than half went for Trump this election. This leaves immigrant rights groups, immigration attorneys and undocumented immigrants in those states in a difficult position: gearing up to fight upcoming immigration policies espoused by Trump, supported by a majority of voters in their region. Kelli Stump, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, has seen the phenomenon firsthand, along with many of her organization’s nearly 16,000 member attorneys. Based in Oklahoma, a state where Trump wonevery county, Stump said a “significant” number of her clients either voted for Trump or have family members who did. “They don’t believe that Trump is going to deport their family member. Trump is going to deport the criminal or the person who just came across the border recently, Stump said, “They think that their family member might be safe.” Through email chains and social media, she sees fellow attorneys doing their best to get ahead of potentially drastic changes to immigration enforcement, including the deportation of whole families and an end to birthright citizenship, both of which Trump reiterated as policy goals in an interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" earlier this month. “We are gearing up for the war. We just don’t know where the battle is going to be yet,” Stump said. In the town of San Juan, just 15 minutes east of McAllen, organizers with La Unión del Pueblo Entero (LUPE), an immigration advocacy group, say they’re preparing in similar ways. Joaquín García, the organization’s director of community organizing, said he’s noticed more fear and uncertainty in this border community since the election, especially after Trump’s suggestion that entire families could be deported together, regardless of their immigration status. “People hear that, and they are in fear. I’ve had people tell me, ‘What’s gonna happen?’ Or ‘I became naturalized a couple of years ago. Are they gonna come after me? Am I still at risk?’"" García said. “We’re also telling people, if you’re a U.S. resident, maybe you should consider applying for U.S. citizenship to have a little more protection, but now we don’t even know if that protection will still be something that’s going to safeguard you from being deported to a country that maybe you’ve never been in.'” García's organization is one of several across the country that are either hosting or planning to launch “know your rights” information sessions for the public, includingSiembra NCin North Carolina,Project New Yorkerin Queens and theUNLV Immigration Clinicin Nevada. In Kansas City, Missouri, immigration attorneys have begun passing out “red cards” that list residents’ rights should they be approached by immigration officials. García said he’s been advising families to keep an easily accessible cache of documents somewhere in their homes in case of a removal order. That file would contain money, evidence that they’ve been living in the U.S. and paying taxes, their birth certificate from their country of origin and — if they have children who are U.S. citizens — power of attorney that allows someone to act on their parents’ behalf in legal matters in case the parents are deported. That’s exactly the kind of precaution Maria, whose last name is being withheld because of her undocumented immigration status, is working on now. Maria left her home country 18 years ago, leaving her then-infant son with extended family to earn a living doing farm work in the U.S. Since then, she and her husband had twin daughters, who are now in their teens and are U.S. citizens. She pays LUPE $40 a year for access to legal and other services in Hidalgo County. She has been paying attention to the incoming president’s words through news reports and social media. “Now we are more than scared, we are frightened, tortured, day after day,” she said in Spanish. She said her family doesn't ask for anything — ""we know how to live with very little"" — but she has one request to the incoming Trump administration: that her family be allowed to stay together, so her daughters can have a better life in the country where they were born."
U.S. charges Colombians in deadly migrant smuggling scheme,"Two Colombian nationals are facing extradition to the U.S. for their alleged role in a human smuggling operation that resulted in the disappearance at sea of dozens of migrants. The two men are alleged to have been part of a smuggling operation known as La Agencia, or The Agency, which ferried migrants from San Andrés Island, a tourist destination off Colombia’s Caribbean coast, to Nicaragua, where they then continued on to the United States. According to thefederal indictment unsealed Monday in the Western District Court of Texas, Hernando Manuel de la Cruz Rivera Orjuela, 52, alias “Patron” (“Boss”), and Luis Enrique Linero, 40, were involved in a conspiracy that included putting some 40 migrants — a group of mostly Venezuelans that included children — on a vessel that disappeared in October 2023. The boat and its occupants have not been found. Rivera and Linero were arrested by Colombian authorities in coordination with the U.S. as part of Joint Task Force Alpha. “As this indictment makes clear, Joint Task Force Alpha continues to be one of the Justice Department’s most effective tools for countering insidious human smuggling operations that fuel suffering and exploitation,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement. Joint Task Force Alpha was started in 2021 with a focus on migrant smuggling through Central America and Mexico. According to the Justice Department, it has resulted in over 345 arrests and 290 convictions. In June, the task force was expanded to include Colombia and Panama in an effort to crack down on migration through the Darien Gap, a jungle pass that, while infamous for its treacherous conditions, has seen a major rise in migrant traffic in recent years. The arrests of Rivera and Linero are the first to result from this expansion. The route offered and managed by La Agencia looks to bypass the dangerous trek through the Darien jungle, offering instead a safe journey to Central America by boat. Adam Isacson, who leads the Washington Office on Latin America’s defense oversight program, said the arrests could deliver a significant blow to networks using this specific route. “They could really reduce a lot of the movement over the maritime space to Nicaragua just by taking down a few key nodes in the network,” Isacson said. Joint Task Force Alpha focuses on migrant smuggling cases that involve aggravating factors such as systematic violence or exploitation toward migrants, or operations that result in mass casualty events, such as the disappearance of the boat off the Colombian coast or asemi-trailer that crashed in Southern Mexicoin 2021, killing 50 migrants. Mandatory minimum sentences for migrant smuggling as a stand-alone offense are relatively low compared to similar offenses like drug smuggling, but these aggravating factors allow prosecutors to seek harsher punishments. Rivera and Linero, for example, have been charged with a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. “These alleged conspirators orchestrated a complex human smuggling operation that recklessly risked human lives for ill-gotten gain,” said Katrina W. Berger, executive associate director of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a component of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that led the investigation into the smuggling network. While Joint Task Force Alpha was started by the Biden administration, analysts believe it is likely to continue or even expand under the incoming Trump administration.
