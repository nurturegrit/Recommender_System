A woman who was with her boyfriend at the Christmas market in Magdeburg has told local media she had her boyfriend in her arms when the car used in the attack came speeding towards them.
""He was hit and pulled away from my side. It was terrible,"" 32-year-old Nadine told the Bild newspaper.
Footage published on German media showed a black car striking a crowd of people at high speed and continuing to drive forward for hundreds of metres.
Nadine's boyfriend is said to have sustained injuries to his leg and head.
Another eyewitness, Gianni Warzecha, told the BBC he was listening to Christmas music at the market with his girlfriend's family when ""suddenly there was a rumbling and the sound of shattered glass"".
""People began to panic,"" he said. ""I saw the car and people on the floor, people bleeding. There were also kids.
""I was concentrating on getting first aid to people. It took a few minutes for the first paramedics to arrive but it wasn't enough because there were already 200 people hurt.
""Most of the first aid was done by people there.""
Lars Frohmüller, a reporter for the public broadcaster MDR who arrived at the Christmas market in Magdeburg shortly after the attack, told the BBC about what he saw.
""Everywhere were ambulances, there were police, there were a lot of fire workers.
""This was a real chaotic situation. We saw blood on the floor, we saw people sitting beside each other and having golden and silver foils around them. And we saw many doctors trying to keep people warm and help them with their injuries.
""It's a big shock. It's a big shock for every people here in Magdeburg and for every person in Saxony-Anhalt.""

Tobias Rausch, who was at the Christmas market and serves as general secretary of Germany's far-right AfD party in Saxony-Anhalt, told Reuters it was scary.
Rausch said he had not reached the market when ""all of a sudden, we heard a muffled noise, an engine roaring"".
""People were screaming. It all happened in a fraction of a second.""
Once away from danger, Rausch said he was able to film the moment police detained the suspect.
Local officials told a news conference that fellow citizens had given vital first aid to those hurt in the moments before emergency services arrived on the scene.

Heike Janke was at the Christmas market on Friday hours before the attack
One Magdeburg resident, Heike Janke, was at the Christmas market on Friday and left at around 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), roughly an hour before the attack took place.
""We could have been hit,"" Ms Janke told Reuters, as she lit a candle for those involved in the tragedy. She said she felt appalled by what happened, ""somehow you just can't believe it"".
She was joined by many other locals who brought flowers and candles to a church near where the attack happened.
Corinna Pagels, a local and employee with a counselling organisation, said she was at the market herself early on Friday. She said the healing for the community starts now.
""Of course, it gets to you and we also need to process things and thankfully we have a good network and are also there to provide aftercare for rescue workers and firefighters and support them in the aftermath. So the real work starts now.""

German authorities are facing questions about security and what they knew about the suspect accused of using an access lane for emergency vehicles to drive into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing five people and injuring more than 200.
On a visit on Saturday, politicians were heckled by members of the public, some seemingly outraged by what was criticised as a security lapse.
German authorities have defended the market's layout and security.
Authorities are also fielding questions after reports they were warned last year about
the suspect
, with police saying they had evaluated whether the suspect might be a threat a year ago.
The suspect has
been ordered into pre-trial detention
on counts of murder, attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm.
Grief and anger in Magdeburg after Christmas market attack
Explained: What we know so far about Magdeburg Christmas market attack
From the scene: Eyewitness heard rumbling and shattering glass
Usually at this time of the year, German city centres are full of shoppers and revellers drinking mulled wine, but this year the mood is very different.
The main Christmas market is cordoned off by tape and surrounded by police vans as armed officers patrol the shops and malls nearby.
There is sadness in the air in Magdeburg, as well as bafflement and anger, as people ask how could this have happened.
As politicians walked out of the cordoned-off market during their visit on Saturday, they were met with booing and heckling and shouts of ""hau ab"", an extremely aggressive form of ""get lost"".
Some people seemed enraged by a perceived lapse in security. Others appeared simply annoyed and irritated in general at Germany's political leaders.
Security has ramped up at Christmas markets across Germany since a similar attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.
Open-plan Christmas markets now have some sort of barrier around them — typically large concrete blocks, which is the case in Magdeburg.
However, the gap in the barriers was large enough to allow emergency vehicles to pass through.
City official Ronni Krug told reporters at a press conference on Saturday that emergency responders needed an evacuation route in case of a ""conventional"" emergency, and all the relevant agencies approved the plan.
""A safety and security concept must, on the one hand, protect those visiting an event as much as possible, but also needs to ensure, at the same time, if something does happen, they are able to leave the site safely and rapidly"", he said.
""Perhaps it is something that could not have been prevented"", he added.
German media reported that before the attack, there had been warnings into a potential threat from the suspect.
Watch Magdeburg attack suspect's 2019 interview with the BBC
The suspect, a doctor from Saudi Arabia named Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, arrived in Germany in 2006 and in 2016 was recognised as a refugee.
An atheist, he ran a website that aimed to help other former Muslims flee persecution in their Gulf homelands. His social media was full of anti-Islamic sentiment and conspiracy theories.
At Saturday's press conference, Magdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said police had conducted an evaluation as to whether the suspect might be a potential threat, ""but that discussion was one year ago"".
He added that investigations into the suspect's past were ongoing and declined to comment further.
Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser told German newspaper Bild that investigators would examine ""in detail"" what information authorities had on the suspect in the past and how he had been investigated.
The German Office for Migration and Refugees announced in a post on social media that it had fielded a complaint about the suspect, which it had ""taken seriously"", but as the office is not an investigative body, had referred the complainant to other authorities.
One tip-off received by authorities is believed to have come from Saudi Arabia, the suspect's home country.
A source close to the Saudi government told the BBC it sent four official notifications known as ""Notes Verbal"" to German authorities, warning them about what they said were ""the very extreme views"" held by al-Abdulmohsen.
However, a counter-terrorism expert told the BBC the Saudis may have been mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany.
On Saturday, Langhans said he did not have information when asked about Saudi Arabia issuing warnings.
Later, the head of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, told public broadcaster ZDF that his office had received a notice from Saudi Arabia in November 2023. He said local police took appropriate investigative measures, but the matter was unspecific.
He added that the suspect ""had various contacts with authorities, insulted them and even made threats, but he was not known for violent acts"".
Past investigations would need to be revisited, Münch said.
Suspect in German market attack appears in court as anger grows over security lapses
Social media under scrutiny
The social media accounts of the suspect are under a great deal scrutiny as investigators build their case against him.
He was a prolific poster of anti-Islamic sentiment and conspiracy theories on X, and had made threats in the past.
The German ambassador to the UK said X owner Elon Musk had questions to answer about why his platform had not taken action against al-Abdulmohsen.
""We have seen that the man who committed this terrible attack was extremely active, threatening on X. The question is, 'does X really act against these things?',"" Ambassador Miguel Berger told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme on Sunday.
""We have a Digital Safety Act in the European Union which requires social media to act [...]. It has not happened,"" he said.
Musk's own account called for Scholz to resign, and retweeted several accounts broadly criticising the German government for failing to act on threats made on social media by the suspect.
The BBC has contacted X for a response.
Musk's criticism of German authorities goes beyond the Magdeburg attack. In the morning before the attack, he posted in support of far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
""Only the AfD can save Germany,"" he said.
Leader of the party, Alice Weidel, thanked Musk for his ""note"" and said ""the Alternative for Germany is indeed the one and only alternative for our country; our very last option,"" in a post retweeted by Musk.
When asked by the BBC to comment on Musk telling Germans how to vote, Berger said: ""I think Elon Musk - before giving unwanted advice to German citizens - he should look at the responsibility of his own platform"".

Elon Musk's curious fixation with Britain,"Elon Musk's curious fixation with Britain

Elon Musk has waded into UK affairs a lot lately
In 2012, Elon Musk had just completed a business trip to London and Oxford. ""Just returned… I met with many interesting people,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I really like Britain!""
Fast-forward to 2024, and Musk's views on Britain are a little different.
""Civil war is inevitable"" … ""Britain is going full Stalin""… ""The people of Britain have had enough of a tyrannical police state"".
These are just some of his recent comments on X, as he renamed the site after he bought it.
He has repeatedly got into spats with politicians including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, he has amplified voices on the right and far-right online and is in talks to donate to Reform UK,
according to the party's leader Nigel Farage
.
So why has Musk's relationship with America's closest ally apparently soured and what, if anything, does he hope to achieve?
We would love to ask him ourselves but he didn't respond to our requests for an interview.
His X timeline offers some clues though.
The self-proclaimed ""Chief Troll Officer"" often exaggerates in an ambiguous way, unclear if he's being sincere or ironic.
When he writes, ""Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?"" he doesn't really mean that Britain is a totalitarian Communist state but also, he sort of does. Often he reposts content with just a single word - ""interesting"" - or an emoji, rather than going into details.
In recent years, however, Musk watchers have noticed that the kinds of things he boosts to his 200 million followers tend to come from a particular place:
a world view that is libertarian and ""anti-woke""
, against progressives and centrists.
'What's happening in the UK?'
The shift was explicit during last summer's riots following the horrific killing of three girls at a dance class in the north-west England town of Southport.
False rumours about the attacker
were circulated on X, including by far-right accounts which had been unbanned since Musk took over the company two years before.
As a protest turned violent and rioting flared, Sir Keir issued a warning: ""To large social media companies, and those who run them - violent disorder, clearly whipped up online, that is also a crime.
""It's happening on your premises, and the law must be upheld everywhere.""
Musk replied with one word: ""Insane"".
PA Media
Musk made several comments about the Southport riots last summer
Later, he would state that ""civil war is inevitable"" and spread a false message from the leader of a far-right party, claiming that Sir Keir was considering building detainment camps for rioters on the Falkland Islands. By the time he deleted the post, it had been viewed more than a million times.
Musk also criticised Britain's ""prison overcrowding situation"" on Joe Rogan's podcast - watched 19m times on YouTube - saying we should ""make Orwell fiction again"", a reference to George Orwell's writings about dystopian society.
While free speech is not Musk's only big issue - he appears to care a lot about existential questions around the future of humanity too - it's a subject that the
Tesla, SpaceX and X owner
has repeatedly returned to.
Just a few weeks ago, in response to a tweet from a right-wing American influencer, making an exaggerated claim about a report from the last government on radicalisation, he commented: ""What is happening in the UK?""
And he may be planning to do more than tweet. He was recently pictured with Farage and Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy, amid reports he is preparing to donate a large sum of money to the party.
Why Musk cares about Britain
Musk's interest in UK affairs could be a reflection of how his
own political beliefs
have changed. He previously described himself as a centrist and even donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign, but now he talks a lot about the ""woke mind virus"".
According to interviews he's given and a recent biography, the transition of one of his children from male to female - and that child, Vivian Wilson, subsequently cutting him off from her life - appears to be one of the key turning points.
Winston Marshall, a former Mumford & Sons guitarist turned podcast host and right-leaning political commentator whose father jointly owns TV channel GB News, speculates that Musk could be picking fights because ""he cares very deeply about the UK"".
""Britain is the birthplace of liberal democracy, of many of the great philosophies that underpin America,"" Marshall says.
""So then he looks over to the UK and he sees what's been going on for several years, but which is now crescendoing after the August riots, with many, many people being given long jail sentences for literally Facebook memes in some cases.""
""Facebook memes"" sounds pretty harmless but these examples include - for instance - a three-month jail sentence for a person who posted a meme along with the caption ""let's [expletive] riot"" on a Facebook group with ""riot/protest"" in the name during the Southport disorder.

Some question whether the tycoon is really as committed to free speech as he claims.
The Center for Countering Digital Hate, which scrutinises social media companies, was critical of Musk's tenure at X - prompting the tycoon to sue, accusing the organisation of misusing data and scaring off advertisers.
The case was thrown out by a US judge.
Its CEO Imran Ahmed called the incident ""indicative of the mindset of a man who simply cannot understand that freedom of speech is a freedom afforded to all, not just to him"".
Other critics have pointed out that Musk has been careful not to criticise the president of China, a country where Tesla has huge business interests, despite
Beijing's well-documented culture of censorship
.
He has far less at stake, business-wise, in Britain, but the country could still affect his bottom line via the
Online Safety Act, passed by Parliament in late 2023
. It will allow regulator Ofcom to issue huge fines to social media companies if they're found to have certain types of illegal content on their platforms.
Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at Loughborough University, explains that while some provisions in the bill are uncontroversial, ""where it gets a bit more tricky is where this illegal content blurs across into what we might call the kinds of disinformation or misinformation that we see circulate on a daily basis on social media platforms"".
This could include ""racially or religiously aggravated public order offences or the incitement of violence,"" he says.
The Act comes with some potentially huge punishments – a fine of up to 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue.
Could it be that Musk is worried about Britain biting off a chunk of X's revenues – or even, as the Act allows for in some circumstances, blocking access to the site in the UK?
Defenders of the Act argue that it's got nothing to do with censoring free speech. Gawain Towler, former head of press for Reform UK, says while Musk might not have ""a forensic knowledge of all the details of backbench committee"" he does ""see the bigger picture"" – what Reform activists and others describe as a creeping culture of censorship.
""You don't have to concentrate always on the trees. And I think Musk sees the forest quite, quite well,"" he adds.
Nobody can read the mind of the world's richest man.
But it's clear that Musk has funnelled his vast wealth into influence and is now exporting his values – including a mainstream American view of free speech and largely unfettered capitalism – around the world.
And one thing's for sure – he's not yet done with the UK.

Hideko Hakamata, 91, fought half her life to free her brother - the world's longest serving death row inmate
When a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the world's longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.
""I told him he was acquitted, and he was silent,"" Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.
""I couldn't tell whether he understood or not.""
Hideko had been fighting for her brother's retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.
In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted - ending Japan's longest running legal saga.
Mr Hakamata's case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japan's justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.
Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners' risk of developing a serious mental illness.
And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didn't commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.
Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014
Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hideko's close care.
When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in ""his own world"" for years.
""Maybe it can't be helped,"" she says. ""This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.
""They made him live like an animal.""
Life on death row
A former professional boxer, Iwao Hakamata  was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the man's wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.
Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (£199; $556) in cash.
""We had no idea what was going on,"" Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.
The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.
He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.
Two years after his arrest, Mr Hakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.
One prison visit in particular stands out.
""He told me, 'there was an execution yesterday - it was a person in the next cell',"" she recalls. ""He told me to take care - and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.""
Before being sentenced to death for quadruple murder and arson in 1968, Iwao Hakamata (left) was a professional boxer
Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japan's death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.
""Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution,"" Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.
""You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you don't know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.""
James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that ""the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading"". The report concluded that inmates were at risk of ""significant mental health issues"".
Hideko could only watch as her own brother's mental health deteriorated as the years went by.
""Once he asked me 'Do you know who I am?' I said, 'Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata'. 'No,' he said, 'you must be here to see a different person'. And he just went back [to his cell].""
Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasn't until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.
Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect 'her little brother'
A key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.
They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamata's defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his - and alleged that the evidence was planted.
In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.
Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hideko who appeared in court, pleading for her brother's life.
Mr Hakamata's fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.
The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered - but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.
That was enough to convince presiding judge Koshi Kunii, who declared that ""the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place"".
Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.
Hideko's first reaction was to cry.
""When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears,"" she says. ""I am not a tearful person, but my tears just flowed without stopping for about an hour.""
Hostage justice
The court's conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.
Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called ""hostage justice"" which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, ""denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning"".
""These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions,"" Ms Doi noted in 2023.
David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.
He said one reason it dragged on is that ""critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010"".
The failure was ""egregious and inexcusable"", Mr Johnson told the BBC. ""Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.""
Getty Images
Hideko campaigned for years for her brother's retrial
Hideko says the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.
But Mr Johnson says false accusations don't happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels - from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.
""Judges have the last word,"" he added. ""When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.""
Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamata's acquittal was a watershed - a rare moment of retrospective justice.
After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised to Hideko for how long it took to achieve justice.
A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visited her home and bowed in front of both brother and sister.
""For the past 58 years… we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden,"" Mr Tsuda said. ""We are truly sorry.""
Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.
""We believe that everything that happened was our destiny,"" she said. ""We will not complain about anything now.""
The pink door
After nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwao alongside family friends and supporters.
Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her ""cute"" little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.
The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.
""We were always together when we were children,"" she explains. ""I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.  And so, it continues.""
She walks into Mr Hakamata's room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.
""He wanted to become a champion,"" she says. ""Then the incident happened.""
Getty Images
Iwao Hakamata, 88, was acquitted in September 2024
After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.
""I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.""
It's the first thing one notices when visiting Hideko's apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.
It's unclear whether it has worked – Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.
But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.
When asked who she blames for her brother's suffering, she replies: ""no-one"".
""Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.""
Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.
Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brother's freedom, says this was their fate.
""I don't want to think about the past. I don't know how long I'm going to live,"" she says. ""I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.""

Christmas can be a difficult time for many, including for those facing financial pressures
Gone are the days when children would circle their favourite toy in the catalogue in the hope of getting what they want from Santa.
Instead, social media
hauls
- where influencers display items they have bought - are the now go-to catalogue, with some parents saying it heaps added pressure on an already stressful time.
Parenting blogger Charlotte Harding said she found the cost of Christmas presents this year ""quite stressful"".
""As the boys have got older, the presents have become more expensive,"" she added.
Charlotte said game consoles and concert tickets were the main items on the wish list, but it is not just presents on the big day that add up.
""The boys have asked for advent calendars that are about £25 plus, which to be honest would be a Christmas present in itself. But this is for the run up to Christmas.""

She said she had also heard of young girls asking for beauty advent calendars costing hundreds of pounds.
Charlotte said social media played a big role when children make their Christmas lists, in particular ""younger and younger"" influencers who advertise products.
""But children don't know the amount of money these things cost... and the parents are really starting to feel the pressure of it.""
Charlotte Harding
Charlotte Harding believes social media hauls are responsible for driving up costs around Christmas
But it is not just Christmas presents and gifts that are costly.
Social media trends such as Elf on the Shelf and
Christmas Eve Boxes
, as well as attending events, are also driving prices up around the festive period.
""The latest trend I've seen is a plane and you go see Santa, and apparently it's amazing,"" said parent blogger Stephanie Handwell.
Stephanie is behind the blog Welsh Mummy Steph and she's felt the pressure of social trends in the past.
""You've got the Polar Express, the Santa experiences and afternoon tea with Santa. I sometimes have to check myself and think when I was a child, I saw Santa once and it was still magical,"" she said.
""It was probably the things we did as a family that I really remember.""
She admitted she has felt the pressure of social trends in the past.
""I've decided to keep my PR calendar minimised because it creates this expectation, and I don't like that because I feel that myself as a parent,"" she said.

Caitlin Acreman, who is behind the Haul at 4 Instagram page, has also scaled back her Christmas-related content because of the cost of living crisis.
""You can still have an amazing Christmas and make loads of memories in a budget-friendly way,"" she said.
Caitlin said she loves to see people celebrating Christmas events online, but she believes ""comparison is the thief of joy"".
""I like to go on my stories a show there is a person there, I'm a mum of two and I'm constantly finding ways to be budget friendly and save those pennies.
""I like to come on there because people can relate to it a little bit better,"" she said.

Elf on the Shelf has taken off rapidly in the UK over the past decade
Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a professor of consumer psychology at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said Christmas can be a complicated period for many and with the added pressure ""to be happy"".
""If you don't have the ability to do that - such as having this massive Christmas meal with your family - then it often leaves people feeling inadequate or lonely,"" she said.
She added that financial pressures can sometimes change people's perceptions of the festive period.
'Bring it back to basics'
Fiona Barnard, who runs the Life of a Crazy Mum blog agrees that Christmas ""can be a tough time for people with mental health and financial issues"".
""More often than not, all children want to do at Christmas is spend time with their family and their loved ones.
""Most of us work full time, some of us are single parents or only see our children at weekend.
""So when it comes to Christmas it's not about running around piling them full of presents or slaving away in the kitchen for half the day, where they don't see us.""
She added we should ""bring it back to basics"" of what Christmas is about.
""It's about family. It's about sharing time and sharing love, as opposed to sharing pits full of money that we don't have.""

Artists imagine a new utopia for Kenya's capital,"Artists imagine a new utopia for Kenya's capital
Kairos Futura
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, has long been known as “the green city in the sun” because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.
Seen from one of the city’s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps – from one of its densely packed slums, then no.
There, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.
But an art collective - Kairos Futura – has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city’s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.
Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience – some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi’s six million residents.
Kairos Futura
Members of the collective worked together with AI to produce images of what an imagined future Nairobi could look like
One of the collective, Stoneface Bombaa, grew up in Mathare, the capital’s second-largest informal settlement.
He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live – often lacking jobs, housing and education.
Bombaa says they endure a “hand-to-mouth economy”, never sure where their next meal will come from.
“People are really angry,” he says, but through art, he feels he can “channel” his community’s anger into something positive as “art unites”.
Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions “micro-utopia” sites dotted around the city.
He called it the “jungle room” and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.
Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road.

The artists want people to draw inspiration from nature and their surroundings
Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi’s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.
“There are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,” Bombaa says.
But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city’s green spaces.
In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor.

Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city’s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.
The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.
For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.
In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future.

Abdul Rop's work features a Swahili proverb which means ""where there's a will there's a way""
Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to “achieve utopia”, Nairobians need to work together.
“That's why the young people are agitating right now for change,” he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.
Gen Z were at the forefront of protests
this year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.
Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.
Rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.
“The moment to act for the future is now,” he says.

Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of acts of genocide in Gaza over water access,"Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of acts of genocide in Gaza over water access
EPA-EFE
HRW accused Israel of deliberately damaging water infrastructure
Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing ""acts of genocide"" in Gaza by deliberately depriving Palestinian civilians there of adequate access to water.
It says Israel's actions include intentionally damaging water and sanitation infrastructure.
The campaign group says this has probably caused thousands of deaths, which it says is also tantamount to ""committing the crime against humanity of extermination"".
Israel rejected
HRW's report
as ""propaganda"".
In a post on X
, the Israeli foreign ministry's spokesman said the group was ""once more spreading its blood libels... The truth is the complete opposite of HRW's lies"".
The 179-page report says that ""since October 2023, Israeli authorities have deliberately obstructed Palestinians' access to the adequate amount of water required for survival in the Gaza Strip"".
It says Israel intentionally damaged infrastructure, including solar panels powering treatment plants, a reservoir, and a spare parts warehouse, while also blocking fuel for generators.
It says Israel also cut electricity supplies, attacked repair workers and blocked the entry into Gaza of repair materials.
""This isn't just negligence,"" said HRW executive director Tirana Hassan. ""It is a calculated policy of deprivation that has led to the deaths of thousands from dehydration and disease that is nothing short of the crime against humanity of extermination, and an act of genocide.""
The report is based on interviews with dozens of Palestinians from Gaza, including water authority officials, sanitation experts and healthcare workers, as well as satellite imagery and data from October 2023 to September 2024.
Israel launched a major military offensive in Gaza after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.
At least 45,129 people have been killed in Gaza since the offensive began, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. It does not put a figure on the number who have died as a result of lack of access to water or other such causes.
The HRW report notes that to constitute the crime of genocide, alleged actions require evidence of intent. It says the findings, including statements made by senior Israeli officials, ""may indicate such intent"".
But, rejecting HRW's allegations on X, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein said Israel had facilitated ""the continuous flow of water and humanitarian aid into Gaza, despite operating under constant attacks of Hamas terror organisation"".
He said water pipelines and pumping and desalination facilities remained operational, and that water tankers had repeatedly delivered supplies into Gaza through Israeli crossings.
""This report is full of lies that are appalling even when compared to HRW's already low standards,"" he added.
The HRW report is the latest in a series of accusations by rights groups and others that Israel is committing genocide in its campaign in Gaza.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) - the UN's top court - is also currently examining a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide.
The Genocide Convention of 1948, passed in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust of European Jewry, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"".
Israel has vehemently denied such allegations as ""wholly unfounded"" and driven by antisemitism. It says it has not intentionally harmed civilians in Gaza, and that it is fighting only against Hamas.

Trump's shutdown gamble exposes limits of his power,"Trump's shutdown gamble exposes limits of his power
Reuters
The government shutdown showdown of December 2024 was the first big test of president-elect Donald Trump's influence over Republicans in Congress.
It was one he struggled to meet. The chaos of the last few days exposed some of the limits of his power and control of his party as he prepares to re-enter the White House.
One day after Trump derailed a bipartisan government funding bill - with a big assist from the world's richest man, Elon Musk - he issued a new demand, for a stripped-down government funding bill that would also raise the limit on how much new debt the federal government can issue to fund its spending.
It was a big ask for many congressional conservatives who have long demanded that any debt increase at least be accompanied by cuts to what they view as out-of-control government spending. And Democrats, and more than a few Republicans, rejected it.
LIVE: Follow latest updates and analysis
Musk flexes influence over Congress
Trump's demand was also a tacit admission that his legislative agenda, heavy on tax cuts and new military spending, was unlikely to deliver the kind of reduction to America's enormous federal deficit that many on the right have been hoping for.
On Thursday night, this slimmed-down bill, along with a two-year suspension of the debt limit, came up for a vote in the House. Thirty-eight Republicans joined nearly every Democrat in voting it down. This amounted to a stunning rebuke of the president-elect, who had enthusiastically endorsed the legislation and threatened to unseat any Republicans who opposed it.
After that defeat, Republican leaders huddled behind closed doors on Friday in an effort to come up with a new plan.
First, they appeared to back a series of votes on individual components of Thursday night's legislative package – government funding, disaster relief, healthcare fixes and a debt-limit increase. It became increasingly clear, however, that any debt-limit increase would be dead on arrival.
After Republicans and Democrats reopened communications, a new plan was hatched. Bring Thursday night's package back for another vote without the debt-limit provision. While 34 Republican budget hawks still rejected that, all Democrats who voted - wary of a government shutdown less than a week before Christmas – jumped on board.
That ensured the bill had the necessary two-thirds majority to pass. The Senate passed it just after the midnight deadline by 85-11. On Saturday morning, US President Joe Biden signed it into law.
Republicans, in a closed-door meeting earlier on Friday, reportedly agreed to raise the debt limit without Democratic help sometime next year, before the US Treasury hits the current cap.
In doing so, however, they also agreed to accompany that move with trillions in spending cuts – from a pot of ""mandatory"" spending that includes government-run health insurance, veterans benefits, government pensions and food aid to the poor.
Such cuts would be vehemently opposed by Democrats and could be controversial among the larger public.
That's a fight for another day, however. For now, it appears the US government will continue to function – at least until the new budget deadline is reached in March. At that point, the Republicans will have to juggle funding the federal government while also trying to enact Trump's legislative agenda on immigration, taxes and trade, all with an even narrower House majority.
In the end, this latest drama underscores just how tenuous the Republican majority in the House is – and the limits to Donald Trump's power.
Republicans abhor compromise with the Democrats, but they will be hard-pressed to muster a majority without them. And when Trump says jump, not every Republican will spring into action.
Trump and Musk showed they can kill a budget, but passing one isn't so easy.

The US and Ukraine say North Korean troops are fighting Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region
What Haneul remembers most about his time in the North Korean military is the gnawing, continuous hunger. He lost 10kg in his first month of service, due to a diet of cracked corn and mouldy cabbage.
Three months into training, he says almost his entire battalion was severely malnourished and needed to be sent to a recovery centre to gain weight.
When they were later deployed as frontline guards to the border with South Korea, rice replaced corn. But by the time it reached their bowls, much had been siphoned off by rear units, and the remainder had been cut with sand.
Haneul says his unit was among the best-fed, a tactic to stop them defecting to South Korea. But it failed to prevent Haneul.
In 2012, he made a death-defying dash across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) – the strip of land dividing the North from the South.
His experience and that of other military defectors helps shed light on the condition of thousands of North Korean troops deployed to the frontline in Russia's war against Ukraine.
BBC/Hosu Lee
Haneul was deployed as a border guard in the Demilitarised Zone with South Korea when he defected in 2012
Pyongyang has
reportedly sent around 11,000 troops
to help Russian forces reclaim part of its Kursk region taken by Ukraine in a surprise summer offensive.
Earlier this week, Seoul,
Washington and Kyiv said
the soldiers had now entered the fight ""in significant numbers"", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed.
However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated.
According to South Korean intelligence, most belong to the elite Storm Corps unit, and have ""high morale"", but ""lack an understanding of contemporary warfare"".
Only the taller, sportier men are selected for the Storm Corps, says defector Lee Hyun Seung, who trained North Korea's special forces in the early 2000s before defecting in 2014.
He taught them martial arts, how to throw knives and make weapons out of cutlery and other kitchen utensils.
But even though the Storm Corps' training is more advanced than that of regular North Korean units, the soldiers are still underfed and even malnourished.
Online videos, reportedly of the troops in Russia, show younger, ""frail"" soldiers, Haneul says. They are a stark contrast to Pyongyang's propaganda videos, where men are seen bursting out of iron chains and smashing blocks of ice with their bare hands.
During his entire time in the army, Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session.
The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables. Haneul says he ignored instructions to ""shoot any intruders"" and let the man go with a warning.
BBC/Maxine Collins
Lee Hyun Seung was a special forces trainer in North Korea in the early 2000s
It is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea. It appears that the country's leader Kim Jong Un has directed much of his limited resources into missiles and nuclear weapons rather than his standing army.
But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are ""incredibly tough"", even for the special forces. The 28-year-old, who worked as a driver in the air force for seven years, says that during his service, conditions deteriorated and rice gradually disappeared from meals.
""The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.""
Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk.
Crucially, the Storm Corps are not a frontline unit. ""Their mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and create chaos deep within enemy territory,"" Ryu says.
But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood.
""Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.""
BBC/Hosu Lee
Ryu says soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice as part of survival training
The language barrier seems to have created an additional hurdle. On Sunday, Ukraine's defence intelligence unit said communication issues had resulted in North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight.
With these assessments, it could be easy to dismiss the troops as ""cannon fodder"" and a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's desperation. But that would be a mistake, the defectors say. Their loyalty to the regime and fighting spirit will count for a lot.
""Most of the soldiers in the Storm Corps come from working-class or farming families, who are highly obedient to the party and will follow orders unquestionably,"" says Haneul, whose father and cousin were in the special forces.
Intense, ideological ""brainwashing"" sessions, held every morning, will further ensure they are mentally ready, Lee adds.  He believes the North Korean troops ""will become accustomed to the battlefield, learn how to fight the enemy, and find ways to survive"".
At least 100 North Koreans dead in Ukraine war, says South
What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's war
Although the soldiers will not have been given a choice over whether to be deployed, Ryu thinks many will have wanted to go. The ambitious will see it as an opportunity to advance their careers, he says.
And given how tough it is to serve in North Korea, some will have relished the chance to experience life abroad for the first time.
""I think they'll be more willing to fight than Russian troops,"" he adds, admitting that in their situation, he too would have wanted to be sent.
Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces, agrees with the defectors' appraisals. ""Just because they lack food and training, does not mean they are incapable. They will acclimatise quickly. We should not underestimate them.""
While 11,000 troops are unlikely to turn the tide of such an attritional war – it is estimated Russia is suffering more than a thousand casualties a day – experts and officials believe this could be just the first tranche, with Pyongyang potentially able to send up to 60,000 or even 100,000 if they are rotated.
In these numbers, Mr Chun believes they could end up being effective.
Also, Kim Jong Un will be able to shoulder big losses without affecting the stability of his regime, the former soldiers say.
""Those who have been sent will be men without influence or connections – to put it bluntly, those who can be sacrificed without issue,"" Haneul says.
He remembers being shocked to learn there were no children of high-ranking parents in his frontline unit: ""That's when I realised we were expendable.""
He does not expect much resistance from the families of the deceased, whose sons, he says, will be honoured as heroes.
""There are countless parents who have lost a child after sending them to the military,"" he adds, recalling his second cousin who died. His aunt received a certificate, praising her son for his heroic contribution.
Reuters
Photos released by North Korea's state media in March 2024 show special forces soldiers taking part in a training session
The loyalty of the soldiers and their families could blunt Ukrainian and South Korean hopes that many will simply defect once they enter the fight. Kyiv and Seoul have discussed conducting psychological operations along the frontline to encourage the men to surrender.
But it seems they do not have access to mobile phones. According to Ukrainian intelligence, even Russian soldiers' phones are seized before they encounter North Korean troops.
So, possible infiltration strategies include broadcasting messages through loudspeakers or using drones to drop leaflets.
Both Ryu and Haneul decided to defect after reading anti-regime propaganda sent across the border from South Korea. But they are doubtful this would work so far from home.
They say it takes a long time to build up the desire and courage to defect.
Furthermore, Haneul suspects the officers will have been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to flee. He remembers his comrades opening fire as he made his daring sprint across the DMZ.
""Twelve bullets flew just a metre over my head,"" he says.
Even capturing the North Korean troops may prove challenging for Ukraine.
In the North, being a prisoner of war is considered extremely shameful and worse than death. Instead, soldiers are taught to take their own lives, by shooting themselves or detonating a grenade.
Ryu recalls a famous military song entitled Save the Last Bullet. ""They tell you to save two bullets, one to shoot the enemy and one to shoot yourself.""
Nevertheless, the former special forces trainer Lee is determined to help. He has offered to go to the frontline to communicate directly with the soldiers.
""It's unlikely they will defect in large numbers, but we have to try. Hearing familiar voices like mine, and others from North Korea, might impact their psychology,"" he says.
Haneul just hopes they get home to North Korea. He knows there is a chance some of his relatives are among the troops sent to help Russia.
""I just hope they make it through and return safely.""

Nurse imposter sentenced to seven years,"Nurse imposter sentenced to seven years
Ottawa Police Service
Brigitte Cleroux impersonated nurses for at least a decade.
A Canadian woman who posed as a nurse and delivered care to hundreds of patients in British Columbia has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
Brigitte Cleroux pleaded guilty in July to assaulting patients by IV injection while pretending to be a nurse.
It is not the first time Cleroux worked as a nurse without medical qualifications.
Tuesday's sentencing marks the end of decades for her in the court system - often as a serial imposter - where she has been convicted of fraud and other related crimes across Canada and in the US.
The sentencing hearing, which began on Monday, heard from former patients, some of whom described how learning of the fraud undermined their faith in the health system.
Cleroux, now in her early 50s, went by multiple aliases including Brigitte Marier, Brigitte Fournier, Melanie Cleroux, Melanie Gauthier, Melanie Thompson and Melanie Smith, according to the College of Nurses of Ontario.
In June 2020, she got a job using a false name and fake resume and references as a nurse at the BC Women's Hospital. She worked there until June 2021, when she was placed on leave following complaints.
She was involved in caring - directly and indirectly - for hundreds of patients who attended the centre for gynaecological surgical procedures, according to court documents.
The Provincial Health Services Authority is facing a class-action lawsuit from some of those patients. The PHSA is not commenting on the matter as it is before the courts.
Cleroux also briefly worked at the View Royal Surgical Centre in Victoria, BC.
Her record of posing as a nurse goes back at least to 2011, in Alberta, according to court documents.
She also presented herself as legitimate in Ottawa in 2017 and in 2021 used fake nursing credentials, a forged resume and a false name to get jobs at two medical clinics there, where she administered needles and injected medication.
One was a fertility clinic where she treated eight patients - a job she quit abruptly when a nurse confronted her about the way she was administering care.
Police began investigating Cleroux when the colleague tried to file a complaint with the nurse's college, which flagged Cleroux's false identity.
She found another job at a dental office but was arrested shortly after.
Cleroux has already been convicted and sentenced for her dangerous ruse, with an Ontario court in 2022 giving her seven years behind bars after she pled guilty to offences including personation, fraud, assault and assault with a weapon.
The sentence she received on Friday will essentially add four years to her time for the Ontario charges.
Altogether, Cleroux has an extensive record of 67 convictions as an adult, including in Florida, mainly for fraud, theft and impersonation.
It is not clear why Cleroux chose to pose as a nurse for at least a decade across North America.
Cleroux is also wanted in the US state of Colorado, for forgery and impersonation, according to an arrest affidavit, in a case dating back to 2001. It's alleged she presented false credentials to work in Colorado Springs as a registered nurse.
She had some training as a nurse, though never completed a degree.

Suspect in German market attack appears in court as anger grows over security lapses
Magdeburg's Christmas market is a sad sight. This should have been the busiest weekend of the season, but the whole area has been cordoned off and all the stands are shut.
Police are the only people walking around the boarded-up mulled wine and gingerbread stalls.
On the pavement, red candles flicker, tributes laid for the victims.
Lukas, a truck driver, told me he felt compelled to come to pay his respects. ""I wasn't there when it happened,"" he told me.
""But I work here in Magdeburg. I'm here every day.  I've driven by here a thousand times.""
""It's a tragedy for everyone here in Magdeburg. The perpetrator should be punished.""
""We can only hope that the victims and their families find the strength to deal with it.""
There is sorrow here – but there is anger too.
Many people here see this attack as a terrible lapse in security. That is a claim the authorities reject, although they have admitted the attacker entered the market using a route planned for emergency responders.
Michael, who also came to pay tributes to the victims, said ""there should've been better security"".
""We should have been prepared better but that was not done properly.""
Investigation: Police probe market security and warnings about suspect
Explained: What we know so far about Magdeburg Christmas market attack
From the scene: Eyewitness heard rumbling and shattering glass
Standing at the security cordon, I heard a group of locals complaining loudly about Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and regional politicians.
""They are wasting our tax money, they are just looking out for themselves. They are not interested in us. We just hear empty promises,"" one man said.
""They are turning what happened here around and want to put the blame on the opposition and use it for their election campaign,"" he said.
On Saturday evening, around the same time as the square in front of Magdeburg's Gothic cathedral was filled with mourners watching a memorial service, a demonstration took place nearby.
Protesters held a banner that read ""Remigration now!"" – a concept popular among the far-right – and shouted ""those who do not love Germany should leave Germany"".
It is not clear yet what impact this attack may have on Germany's upcoming election.
Germany has been hit by a number of deadly Islamist attacks in the past, but investigators said the evidence they have gathered so far suggests a different picture in this case.
Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect appears to have been ""Islamophobic"".
The suspect, Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, is from Saudi Arabia, and his social media posts suggest he had been critical of Islam.
He also expressed sympathy on social media for Germany's far-right political party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), re-tweeting posts from the party's leader and a far-right activist.

"Gaza ceasefire talks 90% complete, Palestinian official tells BBC","Gaza ceasefire talks 90% complete, Palestinian official tells BBC
Reuters
A displaced Palestinian woman in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip
Talks to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas are 90% complete, but key issues remain that need to be bridged, a senior Palestinian official involved in the talks told the BBC.
One of the main sticking points is the continued Israeli military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategically important strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt.
The Palestinian official shared details of the discussions being held in Doha which include the potential creation of a buffer zone several kilometres wide along the length of Israel's border with Gaza.
Israel would retain a military presence within this area, the official said.
With these issues resolved, a three-stage ceasefire could be agreed within days, they added.
The deal would include an exchange of 20 Palestinian prisoners for every female soldier released in the first of three stages of the ceasefire.
The names of the prisoners are yet to be agreed but would be chosen from around 400 names who are serving prison sentences of 25 years or more in Israel.
These are not thought to include the senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, whose release Israel is expected to veto.
Israeli hostages would be released in stages, as it is believed that Hamas still need to locate some of the missing hostages.
Of 96 hostages still held in Gaza, 62 are assumed by Israel to still be alive.
Gazan civilians would be able to return to the north, under a system with Egyptian/Qatari oversight, and there would be around 500 trucks per day bringing aid into the strip, the official said.
In the final stage of the three-phase plan, which would see the end of the 14-month war, Gaza would be overseen by a committee of technocrats from the enclave, who would not have previous political affiliations but would have the backing of all Palestinian factions.
Gaza ceasefire talks in final stage, Palestinian negotiator tells BBC
US to start immediately on fresh push for Gaza ceasefire
In recent weeks, the US, Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts and reported greater willingness by both sides to conclude a deal.
A round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.
Hamas and two other Palestinian militant groups said that reaching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza ""has become closer than ever before"" only if Israel ""stops imposing new conditions"".
In a Telegram statement on Saturday, the group said it held a meeting in Cairo on Friday on the ongoing negotiation efforts with representatives from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
The Palestinian Islamist armed group Hamas, which governed Gaza, carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others abducted.
More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations.

'It's bragging without the selfie' - The rise of Spotify Wrapped and its copycats,"'It's bragging without the selfie' - The rise of Spotify Wrapped and its copycats
Getty Images
Sabrina Carpenter's ""Espresso"" was Spotify's most streamed song in 2024
Throughout December, Instagram feeds are flooded with pictures of Christmas trees, snaps from festive work parties – and screenshots of people's most-listened-to songs of the year.
That's because at the end of every year, since 2016, Spotify releases Wrapped. The campaign pulls together what users listened to the most and usually includes their top songs, artists, and genres.
It's now ""plastered across every possible social media platform known to man,"" says Dr Gillian Brooks, a senior lecturer in strategic marketing at King's College London.
She says its Wrapped feature works so well because music is personal and people enjoy the nostalgia of seeing the songs that marked their lives over the past year.
Since Wrapped goes viral annually, other businesses have joined in, from language learning app Duolingo to bank Monzo, all creating their own personalised ""year in review"" summaries - alongside other music streaming apps such as Apple Music and Amazon Music.
Prof Jonathan Wilson, a professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London, thinks there is an ulterior motive for people sharing these end-of-year-reviews - especially on apps that people use to track their virtuous activities, like fitness and education.
""It's like bragging but without the selfie,"" he explains. ""Lots of people don't want to take selfies for various reasons but one of them is that people feel a bit cringe, that it's a bit narcissistic.""
People share information on social media if it ""enhances the image we wish to portray publicly of who we are and what we want to align ourselves with"", he says.
Apps like Strava will tot up how far you have run or cycled this year, while Duolingo will tell you how many hours you've spent learning another language.
Goodreads provides you with images you can share on social media displaying the books you have read this year, with details about the average page length and your top genres.
""Data is a really good way to humblebrag, as opposed to actually taking selfies in all of your best clothes surrounded by all of your best people and belongings,"" Prof Wilson adds.
""It's less like bragging and a bit more evidence-based,"" agrees Prof Caroline Wiertz, a professor in marketing at City, University of London.
Spotify Wrapped is part of the festive calendar

Prof Caroline Wiertz says the annual unveiling of Spotify Wrapped has become part of our festive calendar
""This is a thing now in the calendar,"" Prof Wiertz says. ""We wait for the John Lewis Christmas ad, we also wait to receive our Spotify Wrapped.""
Other brands jumping on the bandwagon include Tesco and Sainsbury's for your favourite groceries, Trainline and Uber for your most frequent journeys, Monzo and Lloyds for your spending habits, Xbox and Nintendo for your gaming.
Prof Wilson tells the BBC this copycat behaviour was inevitable - the prospect of people promoting a company or product seems like too good an opportunity to miss.
As Dr Brooks says: ""It's free advertising for them.""
Can you remember these 2024 culture moments?
'Barry Island is on the up but it'll never be posh'
Watch: Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr reunite on stage
Some year in review features are more tongue in cheek, which brands hope can make them more relatable, and shareable, to their customers, these experts say.
People typically don't post information about their financial situation on social media. But Monzo has found a way to make its year in review sharable, by telling people whether they're among the top spenders at Greggs.
Reddit tells users the distance they've scrolled, measured in bananas.
And though Prof Wilson says that people typically don't want to post mundane things on social media, like ""which kind of bread roll they bought,"" Sainsbury's shows shoppers whether they were the top buyers of certain products in their local area.
It has led to people
boasting online
about being the top consumer of paprika, toilet cleaner or pickled gherkins.
Tesco
Tesco tells Clubcard owners what their most bought items were - including their top meal deal choices
Year in review features can raise questions about just how much data companies collect. It is widely understood that the vast majority of apps and websites someone might use are collecting huge reams of data, which they use for marketing purposes.
Dr Brooks suggests ""people blindly accept privacy preferences online"" because they want to get on with whatever they visited the website to do.
Data privacy is ""not as huge of an issue as it used to be"", she says. ""If we get more targeted adverts as a result, most people I've spoken to are okay with that.""
And though people like to keep some information about themselves private, they seem to have few qualms about sharing their hobbies and leisure activities online.
""Paradoxically, when you share a selfie you are sharing far less information about yourself than you do with data showing what you do,"" Prof Wilson says. ""People seem more comfortable with doing that than sharing a picture of themselves.""

Who is Magdeburg market attack suspect Taleb al-Abdulmohsen?,"Who is Magdeburg market attack suspect Taleb al-Abdulmohsen?
Suspect in German market attack appears in court as anger grows over security lapses
On Friday evening, a man ploughed a car into a crowd of shoppers at a Christmas market in the German city of Magdeburg.
The attack killed five people, including a nine-year-old boy, and left more than 200 injured, with many in a critical condition.
A judge has ordered the pre-trial detention of a 50-year-old man arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack.
Police believe he acted alone.
Eyewitness account:
Witness saw car hit boyfriend in attack
Investigation ongoing:
Police probe market security and warnings about suspect
How did the attack unfold?
At 19:02 local time (18:02 GMT), the first call to emergency services was made.
The caller reported that a car had driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the middle of town.
The caller assumed it was an accident, police said, but it soon became clear this was not the case.
The driver, police said, had used traffic lights to turn off the road and onto a pedestrian crossing, leading him through an entry point to the market which was reserved for emergency vehicles, injuring a number of people on the way.
Unverified footage on social media showed the driver speeding the vehicle through a pedestrian walkway between Christmas stalls.
Eyewitnesses described jumping out of the car's path, fleeing or hiding.
Police said the driver then returned to the road the way he came in and was forced to stop in traffic. Officers already at the market were able to apprehend and arrest the driver here.
Footage showed armed police confronting and arresting a man who can be seen lying on the ground next to a stationary vehicle - a black BMW with significant damage to its front bumper and windscreen.
The entire incident was over in three minutes, police said.
Who are the victims?
A nine-year-old boy and four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75 are confirmed to have died in the attack.
More than 200 people have been injured and at least 41 of those are in a critical condition.
The toll had earlier been reported as two dead and 68 injured, but was revised to the much higher totals on Saturday morning.
None of the victims have been identified yet.
Who is the suspect?
Video shows arrest of Magdeburg attack suspect
The suspect has been identified in local media reports as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, the BBC understands.
He is a 50-year-old Saudi-born psychiatrist who lives in Bernburg, around 40km (25 miles) south of Magdeburg.
He has been remanded in custody on suspicion of five counts of murder, multiple attempted murders and dangerous bodily harm, police say.
The motive behind the attack remains unclear but authorities have reported that they believe he carried out the attack alone.
Al-Abdulmohsen arrived in Germany in 2006 and in 2016 was recognised as a refugee.
The suspect ran a website that aimed to help other former Muslims flee persecution in their Gulf homelands, and was interviewed about it by the BBC in 2019.
Watch Magdeburg attack suspect's 2019 interview with the BBC
Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters that it was ""clear to see"" that the suspect holds ""Islamophobic"" views.
On social media, he is an outspoken critic of Islam, and has promoted conspiracy theories regarding an alleged plot by German authorities to Islamicise Europe.
He also expressed sympathy on social media for Germany's far-right political party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), re-tweeting posts from the party's leader and a far-right activist.
Magdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said police had previously conducted an evaluation as to whether the suspect might have posed a potential threat, ""but that discussion was one year ago"".
Faeser told German newspaper Bild that investigators would examine ""in detail"" what information authorities had on al-Abdulmohsen in the past and how he had been investigated.
The German Office for Migration and Refugees announced in a post on social media that it had fielded a complaint about the suspect, which it had ""taken seriously"", but as the office is not an investigative body, had referred the complainant to other authorities.
One tip-off received by authorities is believed to have come from Saudi Arabian authorities.
A source close to the Saudi government told the BBC it sent four official notifications known as ""Notes Verbal"" to German authorities, warning them about what they said were ""the very extreme views"" held by al-Abdulmohsen.
However, a counter-terrorism expert told the BBC the Saudis may have been mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany.
The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, told public broadcaster ZDF that his office had received a notice from Saudi Arabia in November 2023. He said local police took appropriate investigative measures, but the matter was unspecific.
He added that the suspect ""had various contacts with authorities, insulted them and even made threats, but he was not known for violent acts"".

Tributes have been left at a church by the scene
What have officials said about the attack?
""The reports from Magdeburg raise the worst fears,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on social media platform X.
Magdeburg's city councillor for public order, Ronni Krug, said the Christmas market will stay closed and that ""Christmas in Magdeburg is over"", according to German public broadcaster MDR.
That sentiment was echoed on the market's website, which in the wake of the attack featured only a black screen with words of mourning, announcing that the market was over.
The Saudi government expressed ""solidarity with the German people and the families of the victims"", in a statement on X, and ""affirmed its rejection of violence"".
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""horrified by the atrocious attack in Magdeburg"", adding that his thoughts were with ""the victims, their families and all those affected"" in a post on X on Friday night.

US avoids government shutdown after days of political turmoil,"US avoids government shutdown after days of political turmoil

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gives a thumbs up walking out of the Senate Chamber
The US government has enacted a budget to avert shutting itself down, but the bitterly disputed deal doesn't include a call from President-elect Donald Trump to increase the federal borrowing limit.
US President Joe Biden signed the spending bill into law on Saturday morning. The Senate passed the agreement shortly after a midnight deadline by 85-11. The House of Representatives approved it hours earlier by 336-34.
Without a funding deal, millions of federal employees would have ended up either on temporary unpaid leave or working without pay.
US government debt stands at about $36 trillion (£29tn), with more money now being spent just on the interest payments than on US national security.
A shutdown would have closed or severely reduced operations for public services like parks, food assistance programmes and federally-funded preschools, while limiting assistance to aid-reliant farmers and people recovering from natural disasters.
Lawmakers earlier this week successfully negotiated a deal to fund government agencies, but it fell apart after Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk called on Republicans to reject it.
The last government shutdown was during Trump's first presidential term in 2019 and lasted 35 days - the longest in US history.
The American Relief Act, 2025 that just passed is 118 pages, stripped down from a 1,547-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected this week. It will fund the US government at current levels until 14 March.
Trump's call to lift the debt ceiling - which was a sticking point for Democrats and some Republican budget hawks -  was not included in the final bill, but Republican leaders said that measure would be debated in the new year.
The dramatic budget fight is a preview of the legislative fights that may lie in store when Trump takes office next month.
""Trying to jam a debt ceiling suspension into the legislation at the 11th hour was not sustainable,"" House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote.
He later praised the bill's passage, saying: ""House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club.""
EPA
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke to the media after the House passed the bill
The deal removes measures sought by Democrats in the first version of the bill, including the first pay rise for lawmakers since 2009, healthcare reforms, and provisions aimed at preventing hotels and live event venues from deceptive advertising.
It does include $100bn in disaster relief funds to help with hurricane recovery and other natural disasters, and allocates $10bn in aid to farmers.
It also includes full federal funding to rebuild Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when
it was struck by a cargo ship in March
.
Musk, who Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his administration, had lobbied heavily against the earlier version of the bill.
During the debate, Republicans said they looked forward to a ""new era"" with Trump taking office on 20 January and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress. Currently, the Senate remains under Democratic control.
The budget wrangling left Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson bruised as he faced criticism from members of his own party, raising a question mark over whether he can win a 3 January vote in the chamber to keep his job.
""We are grateful that everyone stood together to do the right thing and having gotten this done now as the last order of business for the year, we are set up for a big and important new start in January,"" Johnson told reporters after Friday's vote.
He also said that he had spoken frequently to both Trump and Musk during the negotiations.
Musk praised the Louisiana congressman's work on the budget in a post on X, the social media platform he owns.
""The Speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances,"" he posted. ""It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces.""

Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor (centre) and his companions, Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Zoe (Wendy Padbury)
The last black and white Doctor Who adventure to be broadcast on TV has been remade in colour.
The War Games, a 1969 10-episode epic, was the swansong for Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor.
The show has been turned into a 90-minute film colourised by a team led by fan Rich Tipple from Saltdean, near Brighton, and will be screened on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer on Monday.
Mr Tipple, who also worked on the
colourisation of the original Dalek story
in 2023, said: ""I was beyond excited to be given the opportunity to bring this story back to life for a modern audience.""
The War Games marked the end of an era for the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his companions Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Zoe (Wendy Padbury).
The trio land in a battlefield that appears to be a World War One military zone. But all is not as it seems.
Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: ""From the day I arrived back on Doctor Who, this was the plan - to colourise old stories and bring them back to life.
""It looks so vivid and new.""

Lead colourisation artist Rich Tipple and his team spent 12 months working on the project.
He said: ""Some people find black and white a barrier to watch.
""Making this in colour is a chance to open it up to a whole new audience who can now appreciate how good the 1960s golden era of Doctor Who was.""
The adventure saw the first appearance of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords
The War Games was filmed extensively in East Sussex locations including Brighton, Cuckmere and Birling Gap.
Mr Tipple said: ""It was a joy to work on something that had such amazing links to where I'm from.
""It was magic to be able to turn locations that I'm so familiar with into vibrant colour.""
The episode will feature the Second Doctor's never-before-seen regeneration into the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee), alongside recovered footage not seen since the original broadcast.
The War Games airs on Monday at 21:00 GMT on BBC Four and on

Market attack suspect appears in court as anger grows over security,"Market attack suspect appears in court as anger grows over security
A suspect has appeared in court after an attack on a German Christmas market on Friday killed five people and injured more than 200 others.
The suspect, a doctor from Saudi Arabia, has been named as Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, who arrived in Germany in 2006 and was recognised as a refugee in 2016.
It comes as German authorities are facing increasing backlash after the alleged attacker used an access lane for emergency vehicles to drive into the market.
On a visit on Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, ministers and regional political leaders were heckled by members of the public, some seemingly outraged by what was criticised as a lapse in security.

'I'd rather die than leave my mum': Survivors describe Mayotte cyclone horror,"'I'd rather die than leave my mum': Survivors describe Mayotte cyclone horror
BBC/Ed Habershon
Zinedane Mohamed's family ""lost everything"" during in Cyclone Chido
On the night Cyclone Chido hit the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, Zinedine was in his home, a small house made of corrugated iron and wood where he lives with eight of his relatives.
Zinedine had received a warning from the authorities about the cyclone, but he didn't take it too seriously.
""I thought it was like in previous years when they warned that a cyclone was coming but it would just be a bit of rain. So we stayed home.""
This time however the island was about to be hit by winds of more than 124mph (200km/h) - the strongest cyclone to hit the island in almost a century
So far 31 people are known to have died, according to French officials, and thousands more feared missing.
When another, more urgent cyclone warning came through, Zinedine swung into action.
""I told my mum it's never happened before that they send a message like this so I think this time it's serious.""
He suggested they go to their neighbours' place, a bricks and mortar house not far from his, in a poor neighbourhood high up in the hills of Mayotte's Petite Terre, the smaller of its two islands.
But his mum didn't want to go, and he felt he had to stay home with his family. The 20-year-old tourism student is the eldest boy in his family and feels responsible for them.
When the storm started, he and his mum hid his younger siblings under a table. Then there was a loud noise.
""The iron roofing of our house flew off. We panicked and looked for shelter. There were iron sheets, wood and other big objects flying everywhere.""
He took his siblings to the neighbour's hut when he turned around he noticed his mum hadn't followed.
""I decided to go back outside to get my mother even though it was dangerous with the wind and everything. I'd rather die than leave my mum to die.""
His mother stood in the middle of their damaged house holding a one-year-old baby. She was terrified and wouldn't let the baby go. Zinedine snatched him from her arms and ran to give him to the neighbours. He eventually had to carry his mother out of the house.
""Luckily we're all safe but we've lost everything. The only things we were able to save were our papers and diplomas.""
BBC/Ed Habershon
There are fears the death toll from the cyclone will rise significantly
Now he's trying to rebuild his family's home. Finding new building materials is incredibly difficult in Mayotte at the moment due to high demand, and he couldn't afford new roofing for his house so he tracked down some of the corrugated iron sheets that were blown off by the storm and plans to re-use them.
""I'm trying to do what I can. Even though I'm not a builder, I want to do it myself because I don't know if the authorities will help us.""
All across Mayotte, others like Zinedine are attempting to do the same, the sound of hammers ringing late into the night.
But as resourceful as the people of Mayotte are, they're also angry at the lack of support they say they've received from the government.
During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the islands on Thursday,
he was booed whilst trying to make a speech
. As he visited a hospital, frustrated staff complained of being overwhelmed.
Most of the people we spoke to when in Mayotte were yet to receive any state aid, five days after the cyclone.
""We've only received food donations from volunteers who've also given us clothes and water. The mayor's office tried to help a bit but that's it"" says 18-year-old mother-of-three Yasmine Moussa.
She took her three boys, the youngest of whom is just three months old, to the closest shelter, a secondary school in the neighbourhood of Labattoir, shortly after receiving the storm warning on Friday afternoon.
""On the day of the cyclone my children were crying because of the noise. When we  looked outside we saw corrugated iron roofs flying everywhere. They kept asking me what was happening, why everything was breaking,"" she said.
""I said to them it's just wind and rain but the next day when they saw everything was destroyed. They couldn't sleep that night.""
When she headed back home, she could hardly recognise her own neighbourhood.
BBC/Ed Habershon
Yasmine Moussa's home was destroyed by the cyclone
""Mango trees had fallen during the storm and were blocking the roads. My neighbour had to point my house out to me because I couldn't even spot it. There was water everywhere, the toilet was broken, my TV, everything was ruined. I tried to save what I could.
""I was in tears, I never imagined this would happen.""
Now she has nowhere else to go. She says the conditions in the shelter are decent but she needs a house to take her children to. They now sleep on mattresses in one of the school's classrooms with a dozen other families.
""It's not normal to sleep like this. The doors don't lock and sometimes strangers walk in. I worry for my children's safety and that they will try to steal from us.""
The Red Cross told the BBC there are at least 100,000 people in shelters around Mayotte.
President Macron has promised compensation for the uninsured, who make up the majority of the population, but he hasn't said how much they'll get.
The needs are huge: almost all of the islands have to be rebuilt. But some on the political right in France argue that spending too much money in Mayotte will only encourage more undocumented migrants to come to the French territory.
Back in La Vigie, Zinedine says he understands their objections but he disagrees.
""We're humans at the end of the day. And we need help.""

US warplane shot down in Red Sea 'friendly fire' incident,"US warplane shot down in Red Sea 'friendly fire' incident
BBC
An American fighter jet has been shot down over the Red Sea in an apparent ""friendly fire"" incident, the US military has said.
Both crew from the US Navy F/A-18 Hornet ejected safely, with one suffering minor injuries, according to Central Command.
The incident came after the US carried out a series of air strikes against a missile storage site and command facilities in the Yemeni capital Sanaa operated by Iran-backed Houthi militants.
US Central Command added it also hit multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile over the Red Sea.
In a statement, US Central Command confirmed a ""friendly fire"" incident over the Red Sea.
""The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18, which was flying off the USS Harry S Truman,"" the statement said.
It is not clear whether the downed aircraft had been involved in the Yemen operation.
Earlier Central Command said the strikes against targets in Sanaa aimed to ""disrupt and degrade Houthi operations, such as attacks against US Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden"".
The US military also said it struck ""multiple Houthi one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles, or drones, and an anti-ship cruise missile over the Red Sea"" using ""US Air Force and US Navy assets, including F/A-18s"".
Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking Red Sea ships?
The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group that controls north-western Yemen, began attacking Israeli and international shipping shortly after the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians.
Since November 2023, Houthi missile attacks have sunk two vessels in the Red Sea and damaged others. They have claimed, often falsely, that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.
Last December, the US, UK and 12 other nations launched
Operation Prosperity Guardian
to protect Red Sea shipping lanes against the attacks.

A Houthi missile hit Tel Aviv on Saturday with 16 people being treated for minor injuries
On Saturday, Israel's military said its attempts to shoot down a projectile launched from Yemen were unsuccessful and the missile struck a park in Tel Aviv.
Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency medical service, said it treated 16 people who were ""mildly injured"" by glass shards from shattered windows in nearby buildings.
Another 14 people suffered minor injuries on their way to protected areas were also treated, it said.
A Houthi spokesman said the group hit a military target using a hypersonic ballistic missile.
Earlier this week, Israel conducted a series of strikes against what it said were Houthi military targets,
hitting ports as well as energy infrastructure in the Yemeni capital Sanaa
.
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that nine people were killed in the port of Salif and the Ras Issa oil terminal.
The Houthis have vowed to continue their attacks until the war in Gaza ends. The US says its latest strike is part of a commitment to protect itself and its allies.

Valencians struggling to recover from devastating floods,"Valencians struggling to recover from devastating floods

Pascual Andreu doesn't plan to reopen his chocolate business after the factory was damaged by flood water
Pascual Andreu points proudly to a black-and-white photograph stuck to the wall of the premises of his chocolate-making business. Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914.
But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.
""The water came in and water and mud covered everything,"" he says. ""And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.""
He adds: ""All my life working. And for what?""
The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.
But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.
The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.
The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The floods caused extensive damage across the Valencia region
Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Romá, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that ""thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air"" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.
""Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,"" he said.
The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.
Electro Fernández, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost €40,000 ($42,000; £33,000) worth of tools in the floods.
""We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,"" said Patricia Muñoz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.
""We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,"" she says. ""But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.
""This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.""
Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a €17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.
Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place.
The Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told congress in late November that his government was ""making a titanic effort"" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced.
""I think that official financial aid is badly managed,"" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination.
""I think this time the same thing is going to happen,"" he says.

Vehicles damaged in the floods have been collected and piled up
Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Mazón, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.
Mazón has rejected such claims. ""We did the best we could with the information available,"" he says.
Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. Sánchez, however, has insisted that his administration ""fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning"" of the crisis.
Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed €35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.
However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter – partially – in the wake of the October floods.
He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician – which he says will not reopen.
But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.
Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, José España visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.
""Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,"" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over €1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone.
""Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,"" he says. ""In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.""

Another deadly crush in Nigeria at event offering free food,"Another deadly crush in Nigeria at event offering free food
AFP
Food costs have surged in Nigeria over the last 18 months
The number of dead from a crowd crush in the south-east town of Okija in Nigeria has risen to 22, police say.
It is the third case this week of people being crushed to death at events where free food was being distributed.
The fatalities in Okija occurred at a charity event on Saturday, when residents rushed to collect Christmas donations, including rice and vegetable oil.
On the same day, a similar tragedy at a Catholic church in the capital city Abuja killed 10 people, while 35 children died during a carnival event on Wednesday in the city of Ibadan.
How offer of free food led to deadly crush at Nigerian Christmas fair
Is Nigeria on the right track after a year of Tinubu?
Police have now warned organisers to notify authorities before holding charity events in order to prevent such loss of life.
Toyin Abdul Kadri, who witnessed the crush at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Abuja, told AFP news agency the attendees ""forced the gates and forced their selves inside"".
The event involved ""vulnerable and elderly individuals"" and four children were killed, the police said.
In a social media post about the crushes, Amnesty International Nigeria wrote: ""President Bola Tinubu's government must urgently prioritise addressing widespread hunger, higher unemployment and the rapidly falling standard of living.""
Food and transportation costs have more than tripled in Nigeria in the last 18 months.
The global bout of inflation has been exacerbated by some of the policies of the government – designed to strengthen the economy in the long-term – such as ending a fuel subsidy.
In a statement on the deadly crushes, President Bola Tinubu said: ""In a season of joy and celebration, we grieve with fellow citizens mourning the painful losses of their loved ones. Our prayers of divine comfort and healing are with them.""
He urged state governments and the police to enforce strict crowd control measures, and has cancelled all his official engagements in honour of the victims.
He also noted the similarities between the incidents, including one earlier this week in the south-west city of Ibadan.
A
crush at a school funfair
there killed 35 children and seriously injured six others.
Thousands of people had turned up on the promise of free food.
Residents in Bashorun, a suburb of Ibadan, told the BBC the crowd soon exceeded 5,000 with many attempting to force their way through the school gate. Parents are said to have tried to scale the fence surrounding the compound to gain access.
Police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi said the three ""tragic"" incidents highlight the ""urgent need for a more structured and effective approach to delivering aid to vulnerable communities and members of the public in general"".

Five killed in strike on Russia's Kursk after deadly missile attack on Kyiv,"Five killed in strike on Russia's Kursk after deadly missile attack on Kyiv
Reuters
Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched a fresh attack on Kyiv
Russia says five people have been killed in a Ukrainian strike in the western Kursk region.
Ukrainian officials reported earlier that Moscow had launched a fresh missile attack on Kyiv, damaging a building hosting several embassies.
In Russia, the acting governor of the Kursk region said in addition to those killed, nine had been taken to hospital following the attack on the town of Rylsk.
Alexander Khinshtein said a cultural centre, a fitness complex, a school and homes had been damaged in the strike which took place at 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) on Friday.
Russian officials earlier reported six killed, including a child, in Rylsk, about 25km (16 miles) from the Ukrainian border.
But in an audio message on Telegram on Saturday morning, Khinshtein gave the latest update, saying there were five fatalities.
""There were no children among those [killed],"" he said.
Ukrainian troops still hold parts of the Kursk region after launching a surprise cross-border offensive in early August.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said Russia's strike on Kyiv had affected the diplomatic missions of Albania, Argentina, North Macedonia, Palestine, Portugal and Montenegro. It is unclear whether the building housing them was directly targeted in the Ukrainian capital.
At least one person was killed and nine others were injured in the strike which damaged a number of buildings in the city, Ukraine's military said. It is not thought that any of the embassy diplomats were injured.
In a verified video filmed in the Pecherskyi District, Kyiv's second oldest Roman Catholic church, St Nicholas Cathedral. is shown with windows shattered following a nearby blast.
Ukraine's military said Russia had launched 65 drones and missiles across the country overnight, with most shot down.
One man in Kyiv, who said he was the owner of a restaurant that suffered extensive damage following the attack, was filmed cursing the Russians as ""beasts"" as he surveyed the charred shell of a building in front of him.
The video was widely shared on social media.

Oksana, another resident, sent the BBC photos of her destroyed apartment, with the windows blown in and glass and brickwork strewn across the floors.
""I don't understand how I survived,"" she said.
""My balcony flew away, half my walls are gone. My neighbour is in such shock she can't even speak. I have no words for the people who did this.""
A local journalist at the scene told the BBC that one of the buildings nearby had been used by the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, and was likely to have been the target of the strikes, although much of the damage seen by the BBC had affected residential buildings.
In a statement confirming the attack, the Russian defence ministry said missiles had been launched at an SBU ""command post"" in response to a strike on a chemical plant in Russia's Rostov Region two days ago.
But there is also speculation in Kyiv that Friday's attack could be linked to the killing of a
Russian general, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov
, in Moscow on Tuesday.
Friday's attack come one day after
Vladimir Putin's end-of-year press conference
and phone-in show, in which he threatened to launch more ballistic missiles at the Ukrainian capital.
There is concern in Ukraine that Russia could use a
so-called Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile
to hit Kyiv. Moscow test-fired the missile on the central city of Dnipro earlier this month.
Earlier on Friday morning, the Ukrainian authorities issued an air alert linked to the possible launch of an Oreshnik missile, and urged people in Kyiv to urgently seek shelter. It turned out to be a false alarm.

'I wouldn't poo if my husband was at home',"'I wouldn't poo if my husband was at home'
Elodie Guige
Jen Moore said even with chronic conditions, conversations are seldom had about constipation and bowel habits
Teen magazine tips on ""how to secretly have a poo without your boyfriend knowing"" had a lasting impression on Jen Moore.
She said one tip even suggested taking an over-the-counter medication to prevent a woman needing a poo while staying overnight with a partner.
The 35-year-old only recently realised she had adopted some of these habits, but that embarrassment had masked a serious health condition.
When she and her husband first met, she would wait for him to leave the house before she ""went for a poo"", or if he was upstairs she ""would run the taps"".
""I have such a visceral memory of reading this article and I obviously internalised it and hadn't even realised until fairly recently.""
Jen Moore
Jen said her husband Chris has tried to remove the taboo from the topic by initiating the conversation, as it's still something she finds difficult
Last year she was ""forced to be open about something I had kept to myself for years"" when she experienced rectal bleeding.
It was the first time she talked about the issue with her husband, Chris, despite being together nearly 15 years.
Four months after excision surgery for endometriosis, and a hysterectomy for adenomyosis, she was worried the bleeding was a sign of delayed complications.
But a later unrelated MRI confirmed it was deep endometriosis over her bowel.
The women's health campaigner - originally from Swansea, but now living in Cambridge - said: ""I talk about my body parts and periods online all the time, I didn't think I had taboos about my body. But there it was.""
She laughed recalling her medical notes detail that she ""is known for constipation"".
""I have been constipated for as long as I can remember, there were occasions where I would go once a week.
""In fact, I thought if people were in the bathroom really regularly there was something wrong with them - I was raised in the generation where girls are told they fart glitter and rainbows.""
Emma Williams-Tully
Emma Williams-Tully said she has learnt to advocate for herself over the years after feeling dismissed in her 20s
Embarrassment might have held Jen back from speaking up, but that was not the case for Emma Williams-Tully.
The 39-year-old from Wrexham also has endometriosis. She said she felt ""fobbed off"" when she told doctors about her constipation and rectal bleeding.
""When I had constipation no matter what medication I took I couldn't go to the toilet for 10 days at a time and would be in absolute agony.
""I went to different specialists over the border in England and every single colonoscopy came back normal.""
When she was diagnosed with endometriosis at 21, she remembers her consultant admitting: ""We thought you'd been making it up all this time.""
She praised the team of doctors supporting her now, but described the years of endometriosis as ""torturous"".
She has had 11 surgeries in total, including a hysterectomy and the removal of her colon, leaving her with an ileostomy stoma.
""I don't want to scare people and think just because they have diarrhoea or constipation that this will happen to them. But it's about advocating for yourself.""
Julie Cornish said more of us should be familiar with what a normal poo should look like
Julie Cornish, a colorectal surgeon from Cardiff and Vale health board said by the time patients reached her they had ""typically been suffering for some time"".
""Things have escalated, because people are too embarrassed to speak up.
""Constipation is common, it affects about 20% of the population"", she said, but added in the worst cases patients will have a poo as infrequently as once a month.
""It's extreme, but we are seeing patients in their early 20s who have had problems opening their bowels since they were small and it's never gone away. They've taken lots and lots of laxatives over time and have ended up having their colon removed.""
She added there were simple steps that could help.
""The bowel is one of the vital organs of the body, if it doesn't work well - you know about it. But we don't talk about it, that's the issue.
""We need a public health campaign around the bladder and bowel.""
Emma Williams-Tully
Emma has had major surgery to remove her colon and part of her rectum, and now has an ileostomy stoma
Tips for a healthy poo habit
Don't put it off:
""You can get people who decide they are only going to go to the toilet in their own house,"" said Julie Cornish.
""If they go on holiday for a week they take something to stop them going to the toilet because they don't want to do it anywhere else. Or they feel it's unpleasant or embarrassing to go at work, so they withhold.""
Water:
""Make sure you drink plenty of water. Caffeine is very good for the bowels in terms of making it work more, but if you're getting diarrhoea that's not very good.""
Exercise:
""Just a simple walk of 15 to 20 minutes - your core abdominal muscles work a bit like a washing machine and will help the bowels move.""
Diet:
""You can increase the amount of fruit and fibre in your diet. You can look for things like psyllium husk, flaxseed and chia seeds to encourage it to move.""
What should a poo look like? How often should I go?
""A lot of people don't actually look at their poo, but you should,"" said Julie Cornish.
""Is there any blood in there? What's the consistency of the poo look like?
""Look at the
Bristol Stool chart
. If it's type one or type two which is sort of rabbit pellets or Maltesers stuck together, that suggests you need a bit more water or fibre in your diet.
""If you're struggling to empty, or have a lot of bloating, it may be that you're constipated or have some pelvic floor dysfunction - you probably need to see a physiotherapist.
""Generally opening your bowel every one to three days, with a smooth stool is considered normal.
""If you get a significant change in your bowel habit - an increase or decrease in frequency, or if you start to get significant pain, bloating, weight loss or blood in the stool, please go and see your GP.""

The Indian family that built a business empire in Hawaii from scratch,"The Indian family that built a business empire in Hawaii from scratch
Flickr/East-West Center
Gulab Watumull's (left) father Jhamandas began the family business with one store in Honolulu in 1915
In 1915, 29-year-old Indian entrepreneur Jhamandas Watumull arrived in Hawaii's O'ahu island to set up a retail shop of his import business with his partner Dharamdas.
The two registered Watumull & Dharamdas as a business on Honolulu's Hotel Street, selling exotic goods like silks, ivory crafts, brassware and other curios from the East.
Dharamdas died of cholera in 1916, prompting Jhamandas Watumull to send for his brother Gobindram to manage their Honolulu store while he took care of their business in Manila. Over the next several years, the brothers would travel between India and Hawaii as they solidified their business.
Today, the Watumull name is ubiquitous on the islands - from garment manufacturing and real estate to education and arts philanthropy, the family is inextricably linked with Hawaii's rich history.
The first South Asians to move to the island from India, they are now one of its wealthiest families.
""Slowly, slowly, that's how we did it,"" Jhamandas
told
a local Hawaiian publication in 1973.
Born in pre-independent India, Jhamandas was the son of a brick contractor in Sindh province's Hyderabad (now in Pakistan). The family was educated but not wealthy. After an accident paralysed his father, Jhamandas' mother bought his passage to the Philippines where he began working in textile mills. In 1909, he
began
his own trading business in Manila with his partner Dharamdas.
His grandson JD Watumull says Jhamandas and Dharamdas moved to Hawaii after a drop in their Manila business after the US, which occupied Philippines at the time, curtailed ties with foreign businesses.
Their Hawaii business was renamed East India Store soon after Jhamandas' brother Gobindram began managing it. In the following years, the business expanded into a major department store with branches in several parts of Asia as well as Hawaii, says SAADA, a digital archive of South Asian American history.

Jhamandas Watumull and his partner set up their first store on Honolulu's Hotel Street
In 1937, Gobindram built the Watumull Building in Honolulu's Waikiki neighbourhood to house the company's headquarters. According to SAADA, the multi-million-dollar business had expanded to 10 stores, an apartment house and assorted commercial developments by 1957.
The Star-Bulletin newspaper describes products at the store - linens, lingerie, brass and teak wood curios - as woven with ""romance and mystery"" that transported one ""to distant lands and fascinating scenes"".
The Aloha shirts
As Hawaii emerged as a popular destination for wealthy tourists in the 1930s, shirts in bold colours with island motifs called the 'Aloha shirt' became a sought-after souvenir.
According to Dale Hope, an expert in Hawaiian textile and patterns, the Watumull's East India Store was one of the first on the island to carry designs with Hawaiian patterns.
The designs were first commissioned in 1936 by Gobindram from his artist sister-in-law Elsie Jensen.
""Instead of Mount Fuji, she'd have Diamond Head, instead of koi [she'd] have tropical fish, instead of cherry blossoms [she'd] have gardenias and hibiscus and all the things we know here,"" Hope
said
.
The designs were sent to Japan where they were handblocked onto raw silk, Nancy Schiffer writes in the book Hawaiian Shirt Designs.
""These subtle floral patterns, modern and dynamic in concept, were the first Hawaiian designs to be produced commercially,"" Schiffer notes.
""They were sold by the boat load and were exhibited as far away as London,"" William Devenport says in the book Paradise of the Pacific.
Gobindram's daughter Lila told Hope that the Watumull's Waikiki store had American movie stars Loretta Young, Jack Benny, Lana Turner and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson coming to buy these shirts.

Long road to citizenship
Despite their success, it would be decades before the Watumull brothers - Jhamandas and Gobindram - received US citizenship. Their early years in the country were marred by discrimination and difficult immigration laws, the Hawaii Business Magazine
wrote
.
In 1922, Gobindram married Ellen Jensen, an American, whose citizenship was  stripped under the Cable Act for marrying an immigrant who was not eligible for US citizenship. Jensen would go on to work with the League of Women Voters to reform the law and regain citizenship in 1931.
Gobindram would become a citizen in 1946 when a law allowing Indians to gain citizenship through naturalisation was enacted.
His brother Jhamandas, meanwhile, continued to split much of his time between India and Hawaii.
During India's 1947 partition, the Watumull family moved from Sindh to Bombay (now Mumbai), leaving much of their property behind, SAADA says.
Jhamandas' son Gulab eventually arrived in Hawaii to work in the family business and become its head.
In 1955, the brothers split the business with Jhamandas and Gulab keeping its retail portion while Gobindram's family took over its real estate section.
Jhamandas moved permanently to Hawaii In 1956, a few years after the death of his wife and one of their sons, and in 1961, became a US citizen.

Over the years, the family remained invested in the welfare of India and its people. Gobindram was an active member of the Committee for India's Freedom and often travelled to Washington to support the country's case for independence, Elliot Robert Barkan writes in Making it in America.
Gobindram's home in Los Angeles was ""a Mecca for people concerned with Indian independence"", Sachindra Nath Pradhan notes in the book India in the United States.
The Watumull Foundation in 1946 sponsored a series of lectures by Dr S Radhakrishnan - who later served as India's president - at American universities.
Gobindram's wife Ellen was
instrumental
in bringing an international parenthood conference to Delhi in 1959, leading to the establishment of the country's first birth control clinics.
The family's philanthropy has and continues to include funding for educational institutions in Hawaii and in India, endowments for Honolulu-based art programmes and promoting Indian-Hawaiian exchange.

In the past few years, as the family business shifted focus to real estate, the last Watumull retail store closed in 2020. The company
thanked
its customers ""for years of good business and good memories"".
Watumull Properties purchased a 19,045 sq m (205,000 sq ft) marketplace in Hawaii last year.  JD Watumull, the president of the company,
said
, ""The Hawaiian Islands continue to be our family's focus today and in the future.""

Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of US President-elect Donald Trump, has withdrawn her name from consideration for a seat in the Senate.
She stepped down this month as co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), fuelling speculation that she might replace outgoing Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, whom Trump has nominated for secretary of state.
But in a post on X, she said she had removed herself from consideration ""after an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many"".
She said she wished Florida Governor Ron DeSantis luck in hand-picking a replacement to serve out the remainder of Rubio's six-year term, which ends in 2026.
Trump picks Apprentice producer Mark Burnett as UK envoy
In her post on X on Saturday, Lara Trump said: ""I could not have been more honoured to serve as RNC co-chair during the most high-stakes election of our lifetime and I'm truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida.""
She said she had a big announcement to share in January, without giving further details.
Lara Trump was elected as RNC co-chair in March, solidifying her father-in-law's influence over the party as he campaigned for the presidency.
Alongside her husband, Trump's son Eric, and his older brother Don Jr, she emerged as one of the top campaign surrogates for the Republican candidate in the run-up to the election.

N Korea hackers stole $1.3bn of crypto this year - report,"N Korea hackers stole $1.3bn of crypto this year - report
Getty Images
Some of the incidents could be linked to remote North Korean IT workers infiltrating crypto and other technology firms, the report says
A total of $2.2bn (£1.76bn) in cryptocurrencies has been stolen this year, with North Korean hackers accounting for more than half that figure, according to a new study.
Research firm Chainalysis says hackers affiliated with the reclusive state stole $1.3bn of digital currencies - more than double last year's haul.
Some of the thefts appear to be linked to North Korean hackers posing as remote IT workers to infiltrate crypto and other technology firms, the report says.
It comes as the
price of bitcoin has more than doubled
this year as incoming US president Donald Trump is expected to be more crypto-friendly than his predecessor, Joe Biden.
Overall, the amount of cryptocurrency stolen by hackers in 2024 increased by 21% from last year but it was still below the levels recorded in 2021 and 2022, the report said.
""The rise in stolen crypto in 2024 underscores the need for the industry to address an increasingly complex and evolving threat landscape.""
It said the majority of crypto stolen this year was due to compromised private keys - which are used to control access to users' assets on crypto platforms.
""Given that centralised exchanges manage substantial amounts of user funds, the impact of a private key compromise can be devastating"", the study added.
Some of the most significant incidents this year included the theft of the equivalent of $300m in bitcoin from Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, DMM Bitcoin, and the loss of nearly $235m from WazirX, an India-based crypto exchange.
The US government has said the North Korean regime resorts to cryptocurrency theft and other forms of cybercrime to circumvent international sanctions and raise money.
Last week,
a federal court in St Louis indicted 14 North Koreans for allegedly being part of a long-running conspiracy
aimed at extorting funds from US companies and funnelling money to Pyongyang's weapons programmes.
The US State Department also announced that it would offer a reward of up to $5m for anyone who could provide more information about the alleged scheme.

Cyclone Chido kills 94 people in Mozambique,"Cyclone Chido kills 94 people in Mozambique
Reuters
Cyclone Chido has killed 94 people in Mozambique since it made landfall
in the east African country last week, local authorities have said.
The country's National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management (INGD) said 768 people were injured and more than 622,000 people affected by the natural disaster in some capacity.
Chido hit Mozambique on 15 December with winds of 260 km/h (160mph) and 250mm of rainfall in the first 24 hours.
The same cyclone had first wreaked havoc in the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, before moving on to Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.
In Mozambique, the storm struck northern provinces that are regularly battered by cyclones. It first reached Cabo Delgado, then travelled further inland to Niassa and Nampula.
The country's INGD said the cyclone impacted the education and health sector. More than 109,793 students were affected, with school infrastructure severely damaged.
Some 52 sanitary units were damaged, the INGD said, which further risks access to essential health services. This is exacerbated further in areas where access to healthcare facilities were already limited before the cyclone.
Daniel Chapo, leader of Mozambique's ruling party, told local media the government is mobilising support on ""all levels"" in response to the cyclone.
Speaking during a visit to Cabo Delgado on Sunday, one of the most badly affected areas, Chapo said the government is working alongside the INGD to ensure those affected in the provinces of Mecúfi, Nampula, Memba and Niassa can rebuild.
In Mayotte, Chido was the worst storm to hit the archipelago in 90 years, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling from the catastrophe.
The interior ministry in its latest update confirmed 35 people had died.
Mayotte's prefect previously told local media the death toll could rise significantly once the damage was fully assessed, warning it would ""definitely be several hundred"" and could reach thousands.
More than 1,300 officers were deployed to support the local population.
One week on, many residents still lack basic necessities, while running water is making a gradual return to the territory's capital. The ministry has advised people to boil water for three minutes before consuming it.
Around 100 tonnes of equipment are being delivered each day, the ministry said, as an air bridge was built between Mayotte, Reunion and mainland France.
In a statement on Friday, interior minister Bruno Retailleau said 80 tonnes of food and 50 tonnes of water had been distributed across Mayotte that day.
Tropical cyclones are characterised by very high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, which are short-term rises to sea-levels. This often causes widespread damage and flooding.
The cyclone, the INGD said, ""highlights once again, the vulnerability of social infrastructures to climate change and the need for resilient planning to mitigate future impacts"".
Assessing the exact influence of climate change on individual tropical cyclones can be challenging due to the complexity of these storm systems. But rising temperatures do affect these storms in measurable ways.
The UN's climate body, the IPCC, previously said
there is ""high confidence"" that humans have contributed to increases in precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, and ""medium confidence"" that humans have contributed to the higher probability of a tropical cyclone being more intense.

Somali piracy 2.0 - the BBC meets the new robbers of the high seas,"Somali piracy 2.0 - the BBC meets the new robbers of the high seas
BBC
Two Somali fishermen wearing big scarves over their heads to hide their faces glance around furtively as they walk into the room for a secret meeting to tell me why they have recently decided to become gun-wielding pirates - in search of million-dollar ransoms.
""You are free to record - we accept,"" one tells me as they sit down nervously for the interview that has taken months to set up in the small coastal town of Eyl.
This behaviour is in stark contrast to the bravado of the pirates who used to strut around this charming, ancient port nestled between arid mountains on Somalia’s Indian Ocean coast.
It has always been considered strategic, not only because of its location but also because it has a fresh-water source - and during the piracy boom of the early to mid-2000s the pirates made it their base.
It became known as ""Harunta Burcadda"" - the Pirate Capital. From here, they targeted the container ships that transport goods around the world and even some  oil tankers, forcing shipping companies to change their routes.
The regional authorities held no sway - and the local police force was too scared to enter the town.
Pirates kept their hijacked ships anchored offshore and businesses in the town and region profited from ransom payments. Between 2005 and 2012 the World Bank estimates pirate groups earned between $339m (£267m) and $413m.
But the pirates suffered a reversal of fortunes when international navies began to patrol the seas off Somalia and these days the Puntland Maritime Police Force has a base in Eyl.
Most people in the town welcomed this as the pirates brought with them eye-watering inflation, drugs, alcohol and a notoriety that the local Muslim elders shunned.
But the longstanding resentment felt towards foreign shipping, in particular fishing trawlers, has never gone away in a town full of fishermen that depends on the sea for its survival. To this day they accuse these fishing boats of stealing their living - often violently.
""Ships came and took all our equipment and belongings,"" Farah, one of the fisherman-turned-pirates looking out defensively from behind his blue scarf, tells the BBC.
Both his name and that of his friend Diiriye, who is wrapped in a white headscarf, have been changed - one of the conditions of our meeting.
He and a few others had invested approximately $10,000 in a fishing venture for a boat, outboard engine and nets. But Farah says last year the crew of one foreign trawler came and stole the nets, along with its catch, and then shot the engine - destroying it.
The pair give another example: some of their relatives had gone out to check their nets one morning and never came back - usually the fisherman go out at dawn and return before the midday heat hits.
Three days later they were found, floating towards the beach.
""There were bullets in their bodies,"" Diiriye says.
""They had no guns; they had gone to the sea with their nets to make their livelihood.""
Hassan Lali / BBC
Officers from the Puntland Maritime Police Force are now based in Eyl
Farah goes on: ""We work and live by the sea. The sea is our business.
""When someone intimidates you and robs you, it is compulsory to fight. They caused the fight. Had they not taken our property, we would not go to piracy.""
These men - aged in their 30s - are not alone in making the decision over the last year to turn to piracy.
According to the European Union’s naval force Operation Atalanta, which patrols nearby, there were 26 pirate attacks between 2013 and 2019 - and then not a single one from 2020 to 2022. But they resumed in 2023, with six attacks and surged to 22 this year, figures until 5 December show.
Most of these skirmishes do not end up in a successful hijacking - but when it does, it pays. Pirates say they received
a ransom of $5m
to release the Bangladesh-flagged MV Abdullah, hijacked in March 2024. The vessel's owner has not confirmed this, but did say it was freed following negotiations.
Sources in
the
semi-autonomous Puntland state, where Eyl is located, told the BBC they estimate about 10 gangs, each with around 12 members, are operating in the area.
They go off to sea for 15 to 30 days at a time, packing their small speed-boats with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), food and fuel.
Farah and Diiriye say their aim is to hijack a medium-sized vessel deep in the Indian Ocean and then make it back to their mother ship, using its GPS tracking system to find bigger ships to target.
""You can attack the ships using small speed boats,"" says Farah.
Their Bazooka rocket launcher is also an essential part of their strategy.
""We use the RPG to stop the ship. When the ship doesn’t stop, we shoot over it. We don’t kill. The aim is to get something, not to kill. [The aim is] to frighten them,"" says Diiriye.
All this weaponry does not come cheap - so the gangs essentially seek funding from interested investors. The disgruntled fishermen put out feelers and a syndicate is formed often involving different businessmen from the cities of Garowe and Bosaso.
One may fund the boats, another the weapons and a third sundries like fuel. These entrepreneurs sometimes invest in several groups in the hope that one of them will hit the jackpot when a vessel is captured so they can get their cut of the ransom.
And it is easy to get hold of a gun in Somalia - even in Eyl you can pick up an AK-47 for about $1,200, a legacy of its two-decade civil war and years of lawlessness.
Farah and Diiriye say they were not involved in the piracy boomtime and have not taken any advice from retired pirates, some of whom also started out as disgruntled fishermen.
Most of these old pirates have left the area - often they have gone abroad or have repented.
In one famous case a former pirate - Abdirahman Bakeyle - gave away his wealth. In 2020, he donated the houses and hotels he had bought in Garowe to Muslim charities and is now a travelling preacher going from town to town in Puntland urging people to lead an austere and morally upright life.
Adado, a town in central Somalia where pirates once invested, earned the nicknamed ""Blue City"" because their newly built mansions often had blue-painted iron sheet roofs.
A good deal of these houses now lie empty - or available to rent for as little as $100 a month.
In Eyl, the town elders say the main legacy of piracy is the prevalence of alcohol, often smuggled in from Ethiopia, and drugs such as opioids - with concerns that some young men who already chew the stimulant leaf khat, a popular afternoon pastime, are becoming addicts.
The men who gather outside teashops in the afternoons to play dominoes and discuss the news say they do not approve of piracy - although they understand the enmity towards foreign ships.
The recent incident of the three fishermen who were shot dead clearly rankles with many.
Ali Mursal Muse, who has been fishing for lobsters and sharks off Eyl for about 40 years to support his wife and 12 children, believes they may have been mistaken for pirates - as he was years ago.
""We left here with another fishing boat and went to the sea. At the same time pirates tried to hijack a ship. A plane came. My boat came to the shore; the other fishing boat was attacked,"" he recalls.
Hassan Lali / BBC
Hawa Mohamed Zubery believes her fisherman husband was mistaken for a pirate - he has been missing for 14 years
Forty-year-old widow Hawa Mohamed Zubery believes her husband suffered the same fate 14 years ago when he went missing.
This was when piracy was at its peak and she had just given birth to a son, whom they wanted to circumcise.
""My husband was thinking that if he caught a shark then we could pay to have the baby circumcised,"" she tells the BBC, clearly still distressed about his death. She says she struggles to pay school fees for her children from her living selling samosas.
Mr Muse says the main issue for him these days is the unethical behaviour of fishing fleets from countries like Iran and Yemen which often steal his equipment.
He believes they are issued with fake Somali fishing licences by powerful local backers who also provide them with gunmen for protection. He accused them of looting their catches and muscling in on their fishing grounds.
""They have a zone they work and they even come on the beach. When we go and ask for our equipment back, they shoot at us. Recently, they hurt some people. They shot a boy, wounding his hand and leg.""
The fisherman says he has complained to the local authorities on multiple occasions, but nothing is ever done.
Puntland’s Information Minister Caydid Dirir admits the presence of some illegal vessels and says some foreign ships may be granted licences and ""misuse them"".
""Illegal fishing exists in all seas, and piracy can occur anywhere. Progress is being made gradually,"" he tells the BBC.
Illegal fishing has been a controversial issue in Somalia for many years.
Many fishing vessels operate without licences or with licences issued by bodies without the authority to do so, according to the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime.
It quotes evidence, including satellite navigational data, to show that many of the vessels originate from China, Iran, Yemen and south-east Asia. A report from the US embassy in Mogadishu suggests Somalia loses $300m each year as a result.
Operation Atalanta’s Rear Admiral Manuel Alvargonzález Méndez says his forces only target pirate vessels and now also have to protect ships from
Yemen’s Houthi rebels
.
But he maintains the area is much safer and Somalis can now ""cast their fishing nets without fear"" - as does the Puntland Maritime Police Force, which works closely with the EU naval mission.
Hassan Lali / BBC
Elders in Eyl do not want to see the return of pirates
Its commander Farhan Awil Hashi is confident that it will not return to the ""bad old days"" of piracy.
He believes the long-term answer is ""job creation"".
""Young people must get jobs, always. If the person is busy doing something, they will not think about heading to the sea and hijacking ships,"" he tells the BBC.
Farah and Diiriye make the same argument - they say because fishing no longer pays, hijacking a ship for ransom is the only way they can support their children.
They know piracy is wrong - and Diiriye admits he is too scared to tell his own mother.
""If she knew, she would be very disappointed. In fact, she would inform the authorities.""

Albania declares one-year TikTok ban over stabbing,"Albania declares one-year TikTok ban over stabbing
Reuters
Albania's prime minister has announced the government intends to block access to TikTok for one year after the killing of a schoolboy last month raised fears about the influence of social media on children.
Speaking on Saturday Edi Rama declared the proposed ban would start in January.
TikTok said it is seeking urgent clarifications from the Albanian government about the proposed ban.
The social media platform told the BBC it had found no evidence the person who allegedly stabbed the 14-year-old boy, or the victim himself, had TikTok accounts.
During a meeting in Albania's capital Tirana with teachers, parents and psychologists Rama branded TikTok as ""the thug of the neighbourhood"".
""We are going to close it for a year and we are going to start rolling out programs that will serve the education of students and help parents follow their children's journey,"" Rama said.

Edi Rama described the content on TikTok as ""scum and mud""
The blocking of TikTok comes less than a month after the 14-year-old student was killed and another injured in a fight near a school in southern Tirana which had its roots in a confrontation on social media.
The killing sparked a debate in Albania among parents, psychologists and educational institutions about the impact of social networks on young people.
""In China, TikTok promotes how students can take courses, how to protect nature, how to keep traditions, but on the TikTok outside China we see only scum and mud. Why do we need this?"", Rama said.
TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.
TikTok is also fighting against a law passed by the US Congress which would ban the app from 19 January unless it is sold by ByteDance - its Chinese parent company.
T
he US Supreme Court has agreed to hear last-minute legal arguments from TikTok
as to why it should not be banned or sold with a hearing scheduled for 10 January - just days before the 19 January deadline imposed by Congress.
The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and ByteDance have denied.

That particular ban will take at least a year to implement.

Lady Gabriella is the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - with Prince Michael, aged 81, a grandson of King George V and first cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II.
Lady Gabriella's husband,
financier Thomas Kingston, died from a head injury
at his parents' home in the Cotswolds. In October, a coroner concluded that he took his own life at the age of 45.
In a tribute shared at the time of his death, Lady Gabriella and his family called Mr Kingston ""an exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him"".

Swimming mouse among 27 new species discovered in Peru,"Swimming mouse among 27 new species discovered in Peru

An amphibious mouse with webbed feet and a blob-headed fish are among 27 new species scientists have discovered in Peru.
They were found in an expedition to Alto Mayo - which includes the Amazon rainforest - by scientists from the non-profit organisation Conservation International and members of local indigenous groups.
Up to 48 other new species may also have been found, although further study will be needed to determine whether they are new, Conservation International says.
""Discovering so many new species of mammals and vertebrates is really incredible, especially in such a human-influenced landscape,"" said Trond Larsen, senior director at Conservation International.
Alto Mayo is a protected area in northern Peru with multiple ecosystems and Indigenous territories.
It has a relatively high population density, putting pressure on environmentalism through deforestation and agricultural expansion, Conservation International said.
Yulisa Tuwi, an Awajún woman who assisted with the research, said the report ""allows the Awajún to protect our culture, natural resources and our territory"", as it gives them a better understanding of the ecosystems.
""[The Awajún] have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,"" Mr Larsen said.
The expedition also found a new species of dwarf squirrel, eight types of fish, three amphibians and 10 types of butterfly.
Robinson Olivera/ Conservation International
This ""blob-headed"" fish is a type of bristlemouth armoured catfish
This ""blob-headed"" fish is a new discovery to science, but the Indigenous Awajún people who helped with the expedition were already aware of its existence.
The fish scientists were particularly shocked by its enlarged head - something they had never seen before.
Ronald Diaz/ Conservation International
A new species of dwarf squirrel will also belong to a new genus, giving it a higher level of distinction
This dwarf squirrel measures just 14cm (5.5in), half the length of an average grey squirrel in the UK, which ranges from 24 to 29cm, according to the UK Squirrel Accord.
""[It] fits so easily in the palm of your hand. Adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast,"" Larsen said.
""It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.""

Spiny mice are known for their distinctive spines, similar to hedgehogs
Scientists discovered a new species of spiny mouse - named after the especially stiff guard hairs found on their coats, which function similar to the spines of a hedgehog.
They also found a new ""amphibious mouse"", which has partially webbed feet and eats aquatic insects.
It belongs to a group of semi-aquatic rodents considered to be among the rarest in the world, with the few species known to exist only spotted a handful of times by scientists.

Third Christmas away from home for Ukrainian refugees,"Third Christmas away from home for Ukrainian refugees
Olesia Manolova
Olesia and her family celebrating Christmas back in Ukraine
Mum of two Olesia Manolova is spending her third Christmas in Omagh, away from her home in Ukraine which she was forced to flee after Russia invaded in early 2022.
The self-employed marketing manager said Christmas time made the situation harder for her family.
Ms Manolova said she worried she would not return to Ukraine for years.
""When I came here I thought it would take one or two months and then I would return but now I understand it will take longer,"" she said.
""I think about home more, I recently found photos on my phone of Santa's residence in Kyiv, where we are from.
""It was a great day with Santa and the kids and I don't know when we can enjoy a Christmas like that again with the kids in Ukraine,"" Ms Manolova, the mum of an eight-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son, added.
The Executive Office said that by June 2022, a few months after the full-scale Russian invasion was launched, there were 825 Ukrainians in Northern Ireland  under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme and Ukraine Family Scheme.
By November 2024, there were 3,397.
This included those benefiting from the Ukraine Extension Scheme (UES) which enabled Ukrainians to extend their stay.
Mary Lafferty says anyone coming from a place of trauma can find it hard to settle in
Like many Ukrainian parents Ms Manolova said she was worried about how her children would adapt to life back in Ukraine if they spent longer in Northern Ireland.
""The main concerns of all Ukrainian parents for their kids is that as they get older they may have to join the Ukrainian army, especially the boys,"" she said.
""If we return to Ukraine, I am not sure that my kids can adapt to the educational system.
""My daughter only started school here and she doesn't know the Ukrainian programme.
""My son started English at school in Ukraine for him it wasn't so easy but it was easier than for my daughter.
""When she came here she was six and all she could say was thank you and hello and goodbye. ""
'Many Ukrainians are traumatised'
Mary Lafferty, who founded the Empowering Refugees and Newcomers Organisation (ERANO) in the Fermanagh and Omagh area three years ago, said anyone coming from a place of trauma can find it hard to settle in.
It was set up initially to help Syrian Refugees and then expanded to help all new communities in the area.
""The Ukrainians coming here use this centre as a meeting point, not just for practical purposes of form filling etc, but to meet socially as well,"" she said.

""They are confident ladies, some had their own businesses but they have lost everything, their homes, families and businesses.
""They may look confident but it's a fragile exterior – a lot of them are still traumatised.""
She said the women were watching the news constantly, worrying about their families and those they have left behind.
""They see what's happening in Ukraine now and it takes very little for them to break down and start to get emotional about it,"" she said.
""There is also the worry that that they don't have any security here from the UK government, as to whether they can stay here or if they can every become residents, so everything is very precarious for them.""
New visa scheme to open
In a statement the Home Office said it had always been clear that the Ukraine schemes provided temporary sanctuary in the UK only while the war in Ukraine remains ongoing, and that they are not a route to settlement in the UK
It added that the government has announced a new scheme that will allow Ukrainians with permission under one of the existing Ukraine schemes to apply for  an additional 18 months to remain in the UK on expiry of their current visas.
This new scheme will open for applications in February.

Sega considering Netflix-like game subscription service,"Sega considering Netflix-like game subscription service
Sega
Sonic x Shadow Generations sold more than 1 million copies in a single day when it launched in October
Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming.
There are already a number of similar services on the market - such as Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - which see gamers pay a monthly fee for access to a range of titles rather than owning them outright.
Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were ""very interesting"", and his firm was ""evaluating some opportunities"".
""We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,"" he said.
Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers ""shelling out more money"" on multiple subscription services.
It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans.

Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services.
The amount these services individually charge vary depending on the features and games made available. For example, Xbox Game Pass prices range from £6.99 to £14.99 a month, while PlayStation Plus ranges from £6.99 to £13.49 a month.
So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals.
It could also be attractive for people who mostly want to play Sega games - but for everyone else it could result in higher costs.
Rachel Howie streams herself playing games on Twitch, where she is known as DontRachQuit to her fans, and said she was ""excited and worried"" about another subscription service
""We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,"" she told the BBC.
""I think that SEGA will definitely have a core dedicated audience that will benefit from this, but will the average gamer choose this over something like Game Pass?""
And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed.
""As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,"" she said.
But she wondered if Sega did create a rival subscription service if this would lead to their games being removed from other services.
""If so, it could mean that consumers are shelling out more money across owning multiple subscription services,"" she said.
Bringing Sega back
Shuji Utsumi spoke to the BBC ahead of the premiere of the film Sonic 3 on Saturday, after a year in which he oversaw the launch of Metaphor: ReFantazio, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the latest Sonic the Hedgehog game.
Our conversation started in an unexpected way.
The very first thing Mr Utsumi said to me seemed to suggest that the firm, which dominated gaming in the 1990s with a rivalry between Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Super Mario, may have lost its way.
""I want to make Sega really shiny again,"" he said.
He said Sega had been putting too much focus on domestic success in Japan, and needed to re-establish itself on a global stage, which would mean expanding past its base.
""Sega has been somehow losing confidence,"" he said.
""But why? Sega has a great RPG group, Sega has amazing IPs, Sega is a really well-known brand.
""So I was like, hey, now is not the time to be defensive - but more offensive.""
He said the company was too concerned about controlling costs when he took over, and he wants to ""bring a rock and roll mentality"" to gaming.
When I told him that sounded familiar - Sega's marketing in the 90s often tried to position Sonic the Hedgehog as the cool alternative to Mario - he agreed.

Sonic and Mario had a storied rivalry in the 1990s, which significantly boosted sales of Sega's Mega Drive and Nintendo's SNES
He said the firm now simply must ""make a great game"" in the series.
""The next one is going to be a quite challenging, quite exciting game that we are working on,"" he said.
But he would not divulge whether Sega was considering a follow up to the much-loved Sonic Adventure series.
""Sonic Adventure was kind of a game-changer for Sonic,"" he said.
""When we release it, it should be good, it should be impressive - we need to meet or even exceed people's expectations, so it takes some time.""
Part of the series which fans have been clamouring to see return is the Chao Garden - a much-loved virtual pet synonymous with Sonic Adventure.
Mr Utsumi said ""we've been talking about it"" - but would not go into further detail, only that he could not ""say too much about it"".
Sega's future
Mr Utsumi unsurprisingly talked up the firm's successes this year, which have included winning multiple gaming awards with new IP Metaphor: ReFantazio, made by the team behind the Persona series.
But it hasn't all been positive for the firm, with job cuts in March, and Football Manager 2025 being delayed to next year.
""It was a hard decision,"" he said of the cuts
which saw 240 people lose their jobs
.
""But when you reset the initiative, you have to make that hard decision.""
And he said Football Manager had been delayed over ""a quality issue"".
""I mean, financially, maybe providing the game at an early stage can be the better choice.
""But we decided to keep having the quality level - to keep that discipline.""
And he also spoke of how Sega's year has gone outside of gaming, with several film and television adaptations being capped off with the third Sonic the Hedgehog movie releasing on Saturday.
""I just saw the movie - it's so much fun. It'd be nice if that kind of excitement goes on.""

Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign,"Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign

Blake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to ""destroy"" her reputation.
According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address ""repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior"" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie.
Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are ""categorically false"" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.
In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.
The meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address ""the hostile work environment"" on set, says the legal filing.
Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit.
Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director.
In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in ""inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us"".
In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film.
Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous ""pornography addiction"" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and ""no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project"", says the complaint.
Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.

It Ends With Us has sparked some controversy over how the film depicts domestic violence
Ms Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a ""multi-tiered plan"" to wreck her reputation.
She alleges this was ""the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created"".
Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: ""It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.""
Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including ""threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film"", which would end up ""ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met"".
He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were ""intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media"".
In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""
She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.
The film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence.
Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni.
Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet.
It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar.
It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.

In an interview with the BBC at the film's premiere in August, Ms Lively said she had felt the ""responsibility of servicing the people that care so much about the source material"".
""I really feel like we delivered a story that's emotional and it's fun, but also funny, painful, scary, tragic and it's inspiring and that's what life is, it's every single colour,"" said the actress.
Ms Lively, who is also credited as a producer, told the BBC she felt the film had been made ""with lots of empathy"".
""Lily is a survivor and a victim and while they are huge labels, these are not her identity,"" said Ms Lively. ""She defines herself and I think it's deeply empowering that no one else can define you.""

US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed British TV executive Mark Burnett, who produced him on The Apprentice, as his special envoy to the UK.
Trump said it was his ""great honour"" to pick his former colleague for the role, which is separate to the position of US ambassador to the UK.
""Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges,"" he added.
Burnett said in a statement: ""I am truly honoured to serve The United States of America and President Trump as his Special Envoy to the United Kingdom.""
He created The Apprentice and produced it along with a range of other reality TV programmes, winning 13 Emmy Awards.

UK-US relations 'strong' says PM as he meets Biden
""With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.
The president-elect, who takes office next month, has
already picked billionaire donor Warren Stephens as his ambassador
to the UK. While Stephens's nomination requires confirmation by the US Senate, Burnett's role needs no such approval.
Burnett, 64, was raised in Essex and served as a paratrooper in the Army before emigrating to the US in 1982, when he was 22.
He went on to work for MGM and became known as a significant figure in reality television.
In addition to creating and producing The Apprentice, Burnett created formats such as Survivor and Shark Tank - the US version of Dragon's Den.
He helped propel Trump, a real estate developer, to new heights of fame as he starred in The Apprentice from 2008-15.
Getty Images
Burnett is married to actress Roma Downey
Burnett became president of MGM Television in December 2015, but stood aside in 2022 when Amazon acquired the studio.
He had a role in planning Trump's first inauguration in 2017.
Burnett told the BBC in 2010 that Trump was ""fearless"" and ""a big, strong tough guy"".
""He is a very, very down-to-earth normal guy and he's a really, really loyal friend and, as I've seen him with many other people, not the kind of enemy you would want,"" said Burnett.
Trump's first run for the presidency as Republican nominee in 2016 was plunged into crisis as tapes emerged of him telling Access Hollywood presenter Billy Bush that ""you can do anything"" to women ""when you're a star"".
Burnett released a statement at the time denying he was a supporter of Trump.
""Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign,"" he said. Burnett is married to Londonderry-born actress Roma Downey.
Another former producer of The Apprentice subsequently claimed that Trump had been heard making ""far worse"" remarks in recordings from the show.
But Burnett rejected calls to release all outtakes of Trump, saying he was unable to do so and citing ""various contractual and legal requirements"".

One minute he was watching his friend perform on stage (for a £300 salary), while the Rev actor sat ""smugly in the audience"", having just received about £30,000 for a BBC show.
But after doing a swift check of his emails during the interval, he found a payslip labelled ""Box office bonus for The Avengers"". He had
wrongly received a paycheque intended for Spider-Man actor and near-namesake Tom Holland
, as they had briefly shared the same agent.
""It was an astonishing amount of money,""
he told Late Night host Seth Meyers
. ""It was not his salary. It was his first box office bonus. Not the whole box office bonus, the first one. And it was more money than I'd ever [seen]. It was a seven-figure sum.""

for showing up late to one of her concerts in New York. Michael Fellows and Jason Alvarez were incensed that the star took to the stage at 22:30 - two hours later than expected - and didn't wrap up the show until after 01:00.
In a lawsuit filed in New York, they claimed her tardiness impacted their sleep and their ability to ""get up early to go to work"" the next day.
In response, Madonna's lawyers argued ""no reasonable concertgoer - and certainly no Madonna fan"" - would expect her to take to the stage at the advertised time.
The case was later dismissed without a settlement.

Schadenfreude has never been so sweet. Standing in a room full of record label executives who'd refused to release her debut album, Raye picked up award after award after award for the very same record, which she'd released independently in 2023.
She earned six Brits in total, including artist and album of the year.
Viewers compared it to the moment, when Julia Roberts, in the film Pretty Woman, returns to the shop that had refused her custom, brandishing the bags of clothes she bought elsewhere.

Beyoncé goes country
We should have realised Beyoncé was a little bit country. Not only does she hail from Texas, but she ended her Renaissance tour by riding around football stadiums on a giant glitterball horse. The signs were there all along.
She made it official in March with the release of Cowboy Carter, an album inspired by righteous anger (she was treated like a pariah at the 2016 Country Music Awards), and a desire to explore country music's forgotten black roots.
Over 27 sprawling tracks, Beyoncé tipped her hat to rodeo culture, the chitlin' circuit, Honky Tonk, bluegrass, folk and gospel - connecting the dots between genres, and daring the country music establishment to look itself in the eye.
It flinched, of course. Acclaimed as it was, Cowboy Carter failed to pick up a single nomination at the 2024 Country Music Awards.

Their anger escalated over a series of 10 diss tracks, incorporating everything from playground insults (Drake mocked Lamar's height), to serious criminal allegations (Drake accused Lamar of domestic abuse, to which the rapper branded his rival a ""certified paedophile"").
The beef produced an all-time classic in the shape of Not Like Us - earning Lamar four Grammy nominations and a spot at next year's Super Bowl half-time show.
But many hip-hop heads were disappointed at how low the rappers had stooped.

Eurovision's official slogan is ""united by music"", but this year's contest was derailed by politics, backstage tension and in-fighting.
The run-up to the contest was overshadowed by protests over Israel's participation, amid the country's war in Gaza. Contestants from several nations came under pressure to boycott the show, Israel's entrant Eden Golan reportedly faced death threats, and there were multiple reports of backstage harassment.
Dutch contestant Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute after a Swedish crew member complained about ""threatening"" behaviour outside his dressing room. Police later said an investigation had produced no evidence of a threat.
And the Swiss star Nemo, who won the contest, accidentally broke their trophy.

As they headlined Glastonbury for a record fifth time, Coldplay brought out an array of guest stars, from Little Simz to Palestinian singer Elyanna.
But they saved the best 'til last, in the shape of Back To The Future actor Michael J Fox. The star, who has been battling Parkinson's Disease since 1991, received a rush of affection from the 100,000+ audience, as he played two songs - Humankind and Fix You - from his wheelchair.
Martin later said the moment had been a dream come true - because watching Fox play Johnny B Goode in Back To The Future had inspired him to play music.
""It's so trippy to me that we get to play with him because it just feels like being seven and being in heaven,"" he told US chat show host Jimmy Fallon.
Brat summer kicks off
The official colour of summer 2024 was slime green, and the official soundtrack was  hedonistic house bangers - all thanks to Charli XCX and her sixth album, Brat.
The record represented a specific, bad-ass spirit. Charli characterised it as ""a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra"".
There was certainly a bulletproof bravado to tracks like 360 and Von Dutch (""it's ok to just admit that you're jealous of me""); but they were balanced by moments of naked vulnerability, as Charli explored female rivalry and her changing attitude to motherhood.
Formerly a cult favourite among pop fans, Brat made Charli into a mainstream phenomenon.

wrapped up in December
, Swift had made a record $2bn (£1.6bn) at the box office.

What started as a rumour quickly became front page news, as Liam and Noel Gallagher set aside more than a decade of resentment and announced they were reforming Oasis.
""The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over,"" they said in a statement.
In some respects, we'll miss the feud. Liam repeatedly called Noel a ""potato"". Noel memorably described his brother as ""a man with a fork in a world of soup"".
But comedy's loss is music's gain. Despite a farcical ticket sale, in which
prices magically doubled
in front of fans' eyes, anticipation for their 2025 stdaium tour is sky-high.

Strictly scandal
BBC Studios
Giovanni Pernice and Amanda Abbington dancing
The BBC
apologised to actor Amanda Abbington
after she complained about her treatment by her professional dance partner Giovanni Pernice when she took part in the 2023 series Strictly Come Dancing.
It was widely reported that while complaints of verbal bullying and harassment were upheld, claims of physical aggression by Pernice were were not.
Earlier this year, the BBC confirmed  Pernice would not return to the Strictly professional line-up for the new series.
""This apology means a great deal to me,"" Abbington said. ""So too does the fact that the BBC have acknowledged the steps that were put in place to support and protect me and past contestants were ""not enough"".
Pernice said: ""The majority of the false allegations have been thrown out by the review. It has been an extremely difficult year, reading story after story and not being able to say anything in return.""

Critics
dished out rave reviews
for a new Vincent Van Gogh exhibition at London's National Gallery, which runs until 19 January next year.
The Guardian, Telegraph, Time Out and the Times each awarded it five stars.
The show features more than 60 pieces painted by the Dutch artist, who died in 1890 aged 37.

Diddy charged with sex crimes
In a case filed in New York, hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities.
Prosecutors described the star as the head of a criminal enterprise that used threats of violence to force women into participating in
drug-fuelled orgies
with male prostitutes, known as ""freak-offs"".
Combs, who is also facing more than two dozen civil legal cases, denied the charges, and vowed to fight them in court.
However, he was denied bail three times, after judges heard he posed ""
a serious risk of witness tampering
"".
His trial is set to begin on 5 May, 2025.
Rooney returns
Literary darling Sally Rooney returned with her fourth novel, Intermezzo, which
received rave reviews from critics

The book follows two brothers, who seemingly have little in common, but have to navigate their way through grief together following the death of a close family member.
Like Rooney's other novels, chapters alternate from the point of views of different characters. Both brothers are in relationships with age gaps.
""I feel like the older I get the more freedom I have to write about a greater range of life experiences,""
Rooney, 33, told the Guardian.

Following five years of research using techniques such as digital imaging and artificial intelligence, eight restorers will begin ""Operation Night Watch"" by removing the varnish from the painting - in full view of the public, within the glass-enclosed space in The Night Watch Room.
The varnish, applied during a 1975-76 restoration, will be removed using microfibre cloths and cotton swabs.
Grammys celebrate disruptive female pop
PA Media
Chappell Roan was the breakout pop star of 2024
It's been a golden year for the outspoken women of pop.
Whether it was Chappell Roan dripping with sapphic disdain on Good Luck, Babe; or Sabrina Carpenter winking theatrically through the innuendo-laden Espresso, the charts were full of whip-smart lyrics from women who weren't afraid to speak their minds.
Even the Grammys, never knowingly in touch with the zeitgeist, couldn't help but pay attention.
Carpenter and Roan got six nominations each; Charli XCX picked up seven; and Beyoncé grabbed 11 - making her the most-nominated artist of all time, with a running total of 99.
The winners will be announced in Los Angeles next February.
Gregg Wallace steps aside as MasterChef host
BBC/SHINE TV
He's one of the most recognisable faces on British television.
But in November, Gregg Wallace stepped aside from presenting MasterChef
after a BBC News investigation
revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour against him.
In an Instagram video, he blamed a ""
handful of middle-class women
of a certain age"" for the claims - which he later apologised for.
Masterchef's production company Banijay UK has launched a probe and said Wallace is co-operating, while his lawyers have denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.

Jaipreet Hundal had a pretty good weekend when he was crowned the most convincing Dev Patel lookalike in San Francisco
It all started with the Timothée Chalamet lookalike competition in New York which attracted the real actor himself.
Shortly after,
similar contests popped up
across the US and UK with men vaguely resembling the likes of Harry Styles, Dev Patel and Paul Mescal entering into the competitions.
While you might have needed to squint to see the resemblance, the events were a way to ""get people together to have a wholesome time and make new friends"" according to the Dev Patel lookalike winner.

A year after Barbenheimer electrified cinema audiences, two more very different movies went up against each other at the box office.
Both Gladiator II and Wicked Part I were huge hits, taking in hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide.
When it comes to awards though, Wicked seems to have the edge with Cynthia Erivo who plays Elphaba being touted as a potential Best Actress winner at the Oscars.

After quite a few setbacks, British powerhouse Adele
finally ended her Las Vegas residency
in December 2024 after more than two years.
Performing 100 shows at the 4,000-capacity Caesar's Palace, there were plenty of viral moments for the singer, mostly involving the Brit crying over something emotional or getting wrapped up in storytelling.
Earlier this year she said she would be taking a ""big break"" from music after a mammoth run in the US city.
""I'm so sad this residency is over but I am so glad that it happened, I really, really am,"" she told fans at her final show. ""I will miss it terribly, I will miss you terribly. I don't know when I next want to perform again,"" she added.

Russia is executing more and more Ukrainian prisoners of war,"Russia is executing more and more Ukrainian prisoners of war
Facebook
Oleksandr Matsievsky is now an iconic figure in Ukraine after his execution by Russian forces
Ukrainian sniper Oleksandr Matsievsky was captured by Russians in the first year of the full-scale invasion. Later, a video emerged showing him smoking his last cigarette in a forest, apparently next to a grave he had been forced to dig.
""Glory to Ukraine!"" he says to his captors. Moments later, shots ring out and he falls dead.
His execution is one of many.
In October this year, nine captured Ukrainian soldiers were reportedly shot dead by Russian forces in Kursk region. Ukrainian prosecutors are
investigating the case
including a photo showing half-naked bodies lying on the ground. This photo was enough for one of the victims, drone operator Ruslan Holubenko, to be identified by his parents.
""I recognised him by his underwear,""
his distraught mother told
local broadcaster Suspilne Chernihiv. ""I bought it for him before a trip to the sea. I also knew that his shoulder had been shot through. You could see that in the picture.""
The list of executions goes on. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating
reports
of
beheadings
and
a sword
being used to kill a Ukrainian soldier with his hands tied behind his back.
In another instance,
a video
showed 16 Ukrainian soldiers apparently being lined up and then mowed down with automatic gunfire after emerging from a woods to surrender.
Getty Images
Russia and Ukraine have released some prisoners, including this Ukrainian pictured after his release in September 2024
Some of the executions were filmed by Russian forces themselves, while others were observed by Ukrainian drones hovering above.
The killings captured on such videos usually take place in woods or fields lacking distinctive features, which makes confirming their exact location difficult. BBC Verify, however, has been able to confirm in several cases -
such as one beheading
- that the victims wear Ukrainian uniforms and that the videos are recent.
Rising numbers
The Ukrainian prosecution service says that at least 147 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been executed by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale invasion, 127 of them this year.
""The upward trend is very clear, very obvious,"" says Yuri Belousov, the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office.
""Executions became systemic from November last year and have continued throughout all of this year. Sadly, their number has been particularly on the rise this summer and autumn. This tells us that they are not isolated cases. They are happening across vast areas and they have clear signs of being part of a policy - there is evidence that instructions to this effect are being issued.""
International humanitarian law - particularly
the Third Geneva Convention
- offers protection to prisoners of war, and executing them is a war crime.
Despite this, Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Russia's Chechnya, briefly
ordered his commanders
involved in the Ukraine war ""to take no prisoners"".
Getty Images
Ukrainians regularly rally across the country in support of their troops in Russian captivity
Impunity
Rachel Denber, Deputy Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch, says there is no shortage of evidence supporting allegations of Ukrainian prisoners of war being executed by Russian troops. According to her, impunity plays a key part, and the Russian army has some serious questions to answer.
""What instructions do these units have, either formally or informally from their commanders? Are their commanders being quite clear about what the Geneva Conventions say about the treatment of prisoners of war? What are Russian military commanders telling their units about their conduct? What steps is the chain of command taking to investigate these instances? And if higher ups are not investigating, or not taking steps to prevent that conduct, are they aware that they too are criminally liable and can be held accountable?"" she asks.
So far, there has been nothing to suggest that Russia is formally investigating claims that its forces have been executing Ukrainian prisoners of war. Even mentioning similar allegations is
punishable by lengthy prison sentences
in Russia.
According to Vladimir Putin
, Russian forces have ""always"" treated Ukrainian prisoners of war ""strictly in line with international legal documents and international conventions"".
Ukrainian forces
have also been accused
of executing Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such claims has been much smaller.
Yuri Belousov says that the Ukrainian prosecution service treats such accusations ""very seriously"" and is investigating them - but so far no one has been charged.
According to Human Rights Watch
, since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022 the Russian forces have committed ""a litany of violations, including those which should be investigated as war crimes or crimes against humanity"".
The Russian army's record of abuses is such that some Ukrainian soldiers prefer death to capture.
""He told me: Mum, I'll never surrender, never. Forgive me, I know you'll cry, but I don't want to be tortured,"" Ruslan Holubenko's mother says. Her son is still officially classed as missing in action, and she hopes against hope.
""I'll do everything that's possible and impossible to get my child back. I keep looking at this photo. Maybe he is just unconscious? I want to believe, I don't want to think that he's gone.""

"Best albums of 2024: Charli XCX, Beyonce, The Cure and more","Best albums of 2024: Charli XCX, Beyonce, The Cure and more
Getty Images
Charli XCX scored her second UK number 1 album with Brat, which was released in June to rave reviews
When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were ""not going to appeal to a lot of people"".
In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys,
referenced in the US presidential election
, turned into a paint swatch, and named ""
word of the year
"" by Collins Dictionary.
Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a ""poll of polls"" compiled by BBC News.
In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat ""
brilliant from start to finish
"" and ""
pop music for the future
"", praising the way its ""
painfully relatable
"" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.
In the star's own words, the record is ""chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack"".
""The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,""
said the Los Angeles Times
.
The BBC's poll is a ""super-ranking"" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.
Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.
Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter.
In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.
Here's the top 25 in full.
1) Charli XCX - Brat
Atlantic Records
Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.
At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.
Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat:
""I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success
"".
With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.
""Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,"" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. ""She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.""
""Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,"" adds co-producer Finn Keane.
Reuters
Charli XCX started her career playing warehouse raves as a teenager.
Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.
The remix project was ""really, off-the-cuff and last minute"", says Cook, ""but that's been part of the fun of Brat"".
""Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,"" adds Keane. ""You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.
""She's just incredibly musical.""
Billboard:
""Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.""
The Forty Five:
""In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.""
2) Beyoncé - Cowboy Carter
Columbia Records
Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.
The Times:
""The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyoncé her best album Grammy?""
NME:
""A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.""
3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance
XL
The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).
Allmusic:
""When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.""
Mojo magazine:
""Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.""
4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft
Darkroom / Interscope
The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.
The Telegraph:
""Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.""
The Guardian:
""An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.""
5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks
Epitaph Records
Billed by one publication as the ""
poet laureate of indie rock
"", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.
New York Times:
""An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.""
The Line Of Best Fit:
""How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.""
6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World
Fiction
Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.
Speaking to the BBC
, Smith said making the record had been ""hugely cathartic"" in escaping the ""doom and gloom"" he felt.
Time magazine:
""It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.""
Pitchfork:
""It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.""
7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee
Realistik
A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a
continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube
, or as a
download from Bandcamp.
But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.
Uncut:
""Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.""
Stereogum:
""Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.""
8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood
Anti-
On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.
Pitchfork:
""Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.""
Consequence of Sound:
""Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.""
9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX
Interscope
After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.
LA Times:
""Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with ""old-ass flows"" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.""
Complex:
""Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene—figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.""
10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet
Island Records
Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.
Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.
New York Times:
""A smart, funny, cheerfully merciless catalogue of bad boyfriend behaviour.""
Esquire:
""The range, humour, and sophistication of these 12 songs were a revelation.""

Colourful life of 100-year-old artist who's never used a paint brush,"Colourful life of 100-year-old artist who's never used a paint brush
BBC
Glenys says she has lived a fantastic life and is still excited by her work
Acclaimed artist Glenys Cour is just weeks away from her 101st birthday and cannot believe her good fortune.
She has built her long and vibrant life around her passion for colour, met the love of her life along the way and even counted the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas as a friend.
She is still painting every day at her home in Mumbles overlooking Swansea Bay.
Glenys has never used a paint brush, instead preferring the ""immediacy"" of working oil paint with torn pieces of fabric and her fingers.
Glenys' paintings have found their way into numerous private and public collections and she has been exhibited widely in Europe and the US
""It's exciting, it's terribly exciting, I love it,"" she said.
""Colour is the most important thing, certainly in my work as well as in my life.""
She said her career as a painter, printmaker, collage and stained-glass artist and teacher meant she mixed with the ""intelligentsia of Swansea"".
As well as Dylan Thomas, who she fondly recalls as a ""really naughty boy"",  her social circle included composer Dan Jones, poet Vernon Watkins, painter Ceri Richards and sculptor Ranald Cour who she would go on to marry.
This ""pretty hectic"" social life she enjoyed as an adult could not be further from the experience of her childhood years.
Born in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, in 1924, the then Glenys Carthew was an only child and the daughter of a colliery manager.
Her father's job meant the family moved around the south Wales valleys seven times in total, living in a series of manager's houses set apart from the workers.
Every surface in Glenys' studio is covered in paint, paper and painting tools
During the
Depression
of the 1930s, the disparity between her relatively comfortable existence and that of the workers and their families left her isolated from other children.
""The circumstances of my father being a manager in a colliery meant you didn't make friends,"" she said.
She recalled walking behind some terraced houses and hearing a group of children playing and pretending to be her.
""They were playing school and I heard them say 'now I'm Glenys Carthew',"" she said.
""And I realised I was posh, I didn't know... it was shattering actually.""
Glenys is a grandmother to seven and great grandmother to 10
But at home, her imagination was fuelled by the books her father would read to her and she began making up her own fairy stories that she would tell to her classmates.
""When I think of it now I must have been very odd,"" she laughed.
She would also spend hours drawing on paper her father would bring home from work and discovered a passion for creating new colours with watercolour paints.
Becoming an artist was ""inevitable"", she said, and she flourished at Cardiff School of Art, where she was taught by celebrated painter Ceri Richards.
Richards is regarded as
one of the most important British artists of the 20th Century
.
""He opened my eyes, he was wonderful, he taught me how to see,"" she said.
Glenys lives at home in Mumbles, Swansea, where she still paints every day
After college, she took a teaching position in Fishguard, living with her grandmother and aunt, but it wasn't long before she moved to Swansea to take a  job as an art teacher at Glanmor Girls School.
She began attending an evening classes in life drawing at Swansea College of Art, and it was here she met her husband, the sculptor Ronald Cour, who was lecturing there.
She was lovestruck the moment she met him.
""The funny thing that stood out was the fact he had beautiful hands and anyway, I fancied him,"" she said with a glint in her eye.
She decided to hide in the ladies' toilets so she could speak to him as he left the building at the end of the day.
Glenys said her husband Ronald was ""always over my shoulder telling me I was wonderful""
""I waited until he came level with the door and I opened the door and bumped into him,"" she laughed.
""We walked down the stairs together and he said to me 'would you like to come for a drink?'.""
They headed to the now demolished Bush Hotel on Swansea's High Street.
It was to be her first time in the pub and also the first time she met Dylan Thomas, a schoolfriend of her new beau.
""I discovered the best place to meet people when you didn't know anybody was the pub,"" she said.
""I met all the intelligentsia of Swansea really.""
Glenys and Ronald met at Swansea College of Art
At the age of 25, she married Ronald, who was 10 years her senior.
""We had a pretty hectic social life, a wonderful social life, it was a rich social life, music, theatre, everything,"" she said.
""I loved it all, I was so lucky and I adored my husband.
""He was always over my shoulder telling me I was wonderful.""
The couple had a daughter, Jane, and both their careers went from strength to strength.
But in May 1978, Glenys' world was torn apart when Ronald died suddenly and unexpectedly, aged just 63.
""I didn't think I could live,"" she said.
""Honestly, I really thought I couldn't live without him.""

She took a week off work and then threw herself into painting.
""I don't think I'd have got through it if I hadn't,"" she said.
""I immersed myself in it.
""I go through that door and forget everything.""
Almost five decades on, Ronald remains a huge part of her life and she confessed she still speaks to him.
Her living room is adorned with black and white photos of him and his sculptures.
Ronald created this bust of Glenys which is on display in her living room
After losing Ronald, she entered a period of vital creativity and spent three decades teaching at Swansea College of Art.
""I love people and I love teaching,"" she said.
""To be standing up in front of a group of students and trying to open their eyes, there's nothing more thrilling than that.""
Today her artworks have found their way into numerous private and public collections and she has been exhibited widely in Europe and the US.
In 2014, a major retrospective of her work was held at Swansea's Glynn Vivian Art Gallery.
Glenys uses torn pieces of fabric and her fingers to create her oil paintings
To what does she attribute her longevity?
""I think it's the fact that I'm working, I'm sure of it, it's a necessity,"" she said.
""I could never get over my good luck for the whole of my life, I've been blessed.
""I've had a fantastic life. I really, really mean it.""
