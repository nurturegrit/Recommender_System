Snowfall totals ranged from a dusting to six inches, with the highest total \\u2014 9.4 inches \\u2014 in Milton, Massachusetts. Snow showers moved off shore thanks to a strong cold front that's hanging over the region Saturday afternoon, with daytime highs staying 10-20 degrees below average. More snow is possible Saturday night in parts of the mid-Appalachians and Great Lakes, where scattered Winter Alerts remained in place into the afternoon. These areas could see an additional dusting to up to two inches of snow. Breezy winds up to 35 mph are also expected Saturday. Due to the cold temperatures, freeze alerts are in effect for northeast Florida and southeast Georgia Saturday night. Cold Weather Advisories are also in place in isolated parts of New York, western Massachusetts and northeast Pennsylvania for Saturday night. On the other side of the country, heavy rain is pouring down in northern California all the way up through Washington state, and mountain snow is falling from the Cascades to the Sierra Nevada, and will eventually make its way to the northern Rockies. The rain and mountain snow will continue in the region as low pressure systems move onshore. Higher elevations should expect a couple of fresh inches of snow, while rainfall totals through Sunday range from 0.5-3 inches. Wind is also plaguing the west, with gusts up to 65 mph possible. Alerts are in place for parts of California, Oregon and Wyoming. Temperatures throughout the western half of the country will soar 10-25 degrees above average Saturday, with records possible in Phoenix, Tucson, Palm Springs and Las Vegas. By Sunday, this warmer air will spread over the Plains, with highs as much as 30 degrees warmer than average. Potential records on Sunday include Tucson, San Jose, Phoenix and Palm Springs. The warm air will gradually shift over the lower 48 states of the U.S. throughout the week, with highs 10-20 degrees above average in the west and central U.S. by Monday. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be warm, with highs throughout the country at or above average. In some places through the Plains and the Mississippi Valley, temperatures will be as much as 20 degrees above average. The warmer weather probably means there won't be a white Christmas, but a snowy holiday is possible in some areas of the country, and a wintry Christmas Eve iseven more likely.

There\\u2019s Kash Patel, who could become Trump\\u2019s FBI director if he\\u2019s confirmed, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who with Elon Musk will lead a new nongovernmental project called the Department of Government Efficiency. Alongside them, with quieter public receptions, Harmeet Dhillon and Jay Bhattacharya prepare for potential key roles in the Department of Justice and the National Institutes of Health, respectively. And there\\u2019s Vice President-elect JD Vance\\u2019s wife, Usha Vance, who will be the first South Asian American second lady. These Indian Americans are perhaps the most well-represented minority group on the president-elect\\u2019s newly announced team. With this ethnic group making up less than 2% of the population and typically among themost Democraticof all Asian subgroups, many find it surprising. Others say the Indian American community has been poised to fit into the current Republican mold for some time. As Trump cozies up to tech industry titans, continues to lambast China and cheers on India\\u2019s current government, it doesn\\u2019t appear to be an accident that Indian Americans are taking on key roles in his administration, experts said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s remarkable how disproportionately represented Indian Americans are compared to other communities of color,\\u201d said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data. Their embrace of some of Trump\\u2019s positions \\u2014 like Patel\\u2019s baselessaccusationsabout a secret \\u201cdeep state\\u201d and Ramaswamy\\u2019s calls for massdeportations\\u2014 are out of sync with the politics of most Indian Americans, experts said. But that might be changing. NBC News polling did not disaggregate for ethnicity, but according to national surveys of the Asian American electorate by AAPI Data, support for Democratic candidates has dipped. After the2016 election, 77% of Indian Americans said they voted for Hillary Clinton. In September 2024, 69% said they planned to vote for Harris. Asian Americans more broadlyshiftedright by 5 points, compared to 3.2 points for thegeneral population. \\u201cTrump had higher support among 18- to 34-year-old Indian Americans, and especially among Indian American men,\\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just the native-born younger men like Ramaswamy and Kash Patel. It includes foreign-born younger men who are likely recently naturalized. You probably have a fair number of people working in tech.\\u201d Some find this mutual affinity contradictory to the story that brought them to the U.S. Trump campaigned on a heavily anti-immigrant platform, with allies like Ramaswamy promising to slash the H-1B visa program and even revoke birthright citizenship. In a statement to NBC News, the Trump team said Biden\\u2019s \\u201cincompetence\\u201d and undocumented immigration brought Indian Americans into the party. \\u201cFed up with the last four years of economic stagnation, unlimited illegal immigration, and general incompetence under the Biden administration, Indian Americans came out in historic numbers to give President Donald J. Trump and his agenda to Make America Great Again a resounding mandate,\\u201d said Kush Desai, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson. Neither Ramaswamy nor Patel responded to requests for comment. \\u201cI think it fits really well with Trump\\u2019s vision of what he wants his right-wing, conservative, populist politics to look like,\\u201d said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University in New Jersey and the author of \\u201cDesis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans.\\u201d According to experts, a set of current national and international circumstances have helped create a runway for the GOP to embrace people like Patel and Ramaswamy when they otherwise might not have. At home, Indian Americans are thriving, they said. They\\u2019re on average the highest earners in the U.S. They\\u2019re overrepresented in the tech industry, and 77% of them have a bachelor\\u2019s degree or higher, according to AAPI Data. This didn\\u2019t just happen naturally. Much of it stems from the first major wave of Indian immigration to the U.S. in the 1960s and \\u201970s \\u2014 mostly young people looking to enter white-collar fields. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very demographically specific group in terms of caste, class and access to education that they had in India that allowed them to come to the United States,\\u201d said Madhavi Murthy, an associate professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \\u201cThe current cohort of prominent Indian Americans that we\\u2019re seeing now in political life are the children of this group.\\u201d Ramaswamy\\u2019s, Patel\\u2019s and even Usha Vance\\u2019s stories fit that mold. Ramaswamy\\u2019s father is an engineer and so is Vance\\u2019s \\u2014 Patel\\u2019s father works in finance. Vance and Ramaswamy also both happen to be from upper-caste families \\u2014 privileged in India\\u2019s stringent caste hierarchy, which, though illegal, still dictates much of social and economic life on the subcontinent. Ramaswamy describes learning about his high-caste Brahmin roots in his 2021 book \\u201cWoke Inc.\\u201d \\u201cKings were below us,\\u201d he wrote, also mentioning how his family\\u2019s servants of a lower caste were required to enter the home through a different door and follow a different set of rules. \\u201cCaste privilege is part of who they are,\\u201d Mishra said. \\u201cSome of that does open up the possibilities of adopting a deeply, deeply conservative and hierarchical way of thinking about the world.\\u201d While Mishra says he doesn\\u2019t think Trump overtly considered race and caste when selecting his staff, he thinks those attributes could contribute to their personas as \\u201cmodel minorities\\u201d and their families\\u2019 immigrant success stories in the U.S. Also convenient for rising Indian Americans in the GOP is Trump\\u2019s icy relationship with China. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a less crowded field in terms of talented people of color in the Republican Party,\\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more difficult for Chinese Americans to serve in prominent positions now than a decade ago or two decades ago because of increased tensions between the U.S. and China.\\u201d On the other hand, Trump\\u2019s perception of India and its Prime Minister Narendra Modi is strong. Some experts credit some of the Indian American, and in particular Hindu, success in the Trump administration to the president-elect\\u2019s affection for Modi and his government \\u2014 a right-wing nationalist movement that some human rights groups blame for the rolling back of civil rights in India. Trump has put his close relationship with Modi on display on several occasions, joining hands with him at \\u201cHowdy, Modi!,\\u201d a rally in Houston that drew tens of thousands of Indian Americans in 2019. While none of Trump\\u2019s Indian American staff picks have spoken much about India\\u2019s government, both Patel and Ramaswamy have beenvocalin their support for Modi\\u2019sactionsin the past. Another Hindu Cabinet nominee, Tulsi Gabbard, has met with the controversial prime minister multiple times and championed him in the U.S. Gabbard, who is Samoan American and converted to Hinduism in childhood, could be Modi\\u2019s fiercest ally in the administration. In a video message welcoming Modi to the U.S. in 2019, Gabbard described India as one of the United States\\u2019 \\u201cmost important partners.\\u201d She has also parroted Hindu nationalisttalking pointsabout \\u201cHinduphobia\\u201dgrowing in the U.S.andprotectingHindus from jihadist Muslims, something that Trump, too, has capitalized on. \\u201cThe Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,\\u201d Trumpsaidin a 2016 Diwali campaign message organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition. \\u201cWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\\u201d In a statement to NBC News, Gabbard\\u2019s team said backlash against her for her connection with Modi is \\u201cbigoted.\\u201d \\u201cThe repeated attacks that Lt Col. Tulsi Gabbard has sustained from the media and Democrats about her faith and loyalty to our country are not only false they are bigoted as well,\\u201d transition team spokesperson Alexa Henning said in an email. \\u201cJust like President Trump she also recognizes the importance of U.S. \\u2014 India relations and working closely together to strengthen ties especially among common interests like combatting terrorism and strengthening economic ties.\\u201d While Trump isn\\u2019t necessarily assessing Indian American nominees based on their relationships with India, Mishra said, the partnership creates fertile ground for more Indian and Hindu politicians to come up in the GOP. \\u201cThey may or may not be aligned to Hindu right-wing politics, but larger right-wing politics is what brings them together,\\u201d he said. Not everyone is on board with the Trump administration\\u2019s perceived inclusion of Indian Americans, no matter how much their policy visions align. \\u201cThere is definitely an element of the right which is deeply racist and white supremacist,\\u201d Mishra said. Far-right and white nationalist Trump supporters have lashed out at the number of brown faces in Trump\\u2019s orbit, posting on platforms like X that they think this is a signal of softness on immigration. \\u201cJD Vance\\u2019s wife \\u2018Usha\\u2019 was not raised Christian and is not a Christian,\\u201d posted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist influencer whom Trump oncehostedfor dinner. \\u201cWhat kind of family is this?\\u201d \\u201cDo we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and names their kid Vivek is gonna support white identity?\\u201d Fuentessaidin another video. Similar far-right accounts echoed that sentiment, with one posting photos of Patel, Ramaswamy and Usha Vance\\u2019s family captioned \\u201cthe future of \\u2018conservatism.\\u2019\\u201d In July, when Dhillon delivered a Sikh prayer at the Republican National Convention, she was the subject of similar trolling, with big right-wingaccountsaccusing her of \\u201cwitchcraft\\u201d and calling for her deportation. Dhillon\\u2019s team declined to comment. Vance and Ramaswamy have both openly spoken about being Hindu, but it often comes with a caveat. Vance saidin a Fox News interviewwith her husband that despite her faith, she pushed him to get closer to Christianity. Ramaswamy has tried to hedge his Hindu faith by quoting Bible verses on the campaign trail and telling voters, \\u201cWe share the same values, the same Judeo-Christian values in power.\\u201d Ramaswamy\\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment but in August told NBC News that they disagreed with that characterization. \\u201cYes, he knows the Bible better than many self-proclaimed Christians, but that\\u2019s exactly what allows him to speak with authority about shared values,\\u201d his senior adviser and communications director Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News. \\u201cHe has given speeches where he invokes a fundamental teaching from Hindu scripture, the Vedas: \\u2018satyam vara, dharmam chara.\\u2019 It means: speak truth, do your duty. Which happens to be the heart of Vivek\\u2019s message to our country.\\u201d But experts said that to a right-wing base that loves Trump for his anti-immigrant stances and \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d rhetoric, no amount of assimilative behavior will win everyone over. \\u201cI\\u2019m old enough to vividly remember post 9/11, many Muslims, many Hindus, many Sikhs from South Asian communities went into overdrive to prove that \\u2018we are truly Americans,\\u2019\\u201d said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. \\u201cWe know today that does not work.\\u201d While speaking with Vivek Ramaswamy on his podcast earlier this year, conservative pundit Ann Coulter started by telling him, \\u201cI agreed with many, many things you said \\u2026 when you were running for president. But I still would not have voted for you because you\\u2019re an Indian.\\u201d Sakshi Venkatraman is a reporter for NBC Asian America.\",\n          \"Houston Texans star receiver Tank Dell went down with an apparent gruesome knee injury in the third quarter of Saturday's contest against the Kansas City Chief. The injury, which led to Dell being carted off the field, was so devastating it had several of his teammates holding back tears on the sidelines. The injury occurred on a play that Houston initially celebrated -- a 30-yard touchdown catch by Dell from quarterback CJ Stroud that pulled the Texans (9-5) within 17-16 on the scoreboard. As Dell caught the pass in the back of the end zone, however, he was hit near the knee by teammate Jared Wayne, who had also been running a deep route into the end zone. Dell was quickly tended to by medical personnel before being loaded onto a stretcher. Stroud, who last season called Dell his closest friend on the Texans roster, was emotional watching the aftermath of the play. It could be the second major leg injury of Dell\\u2019s career, after a broken leg sidelined him during his rookie season in 2023. Saturday\\u2019s game had long been defined by injuries, after the spotlight all week had been on whether Chiefs (13-1) quarterback Patrick Mahomes would play after suffering an ankle injury only six days earlier. Mahomes started, however, and even rushed for a 15-yard touchdown in the first quarter.

Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies. While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire\\u2019s words carry weight well beyond the tech world. Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called \\u201cwoke mind virus\\u201d and championing anti-immigration rhetoric. His transformation aligns with the resurgence ofPresident-elect Donald Trumpand the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France\\u2019s National Rally,led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politicianGeert Wilders. His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire\\u2019s politics. Musk\\u2019s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a \\u201ctyrannical police state,\\u201d amplified calls for a general electionjust months after Starmer became prime minister,and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist. Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe,Musklast weekopenly endorsedGermany\\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country\\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. The AfD\\u2019s leader, Bj\\u00f6rn H\\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefullyemploying Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings. Musk\\u2019s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany\\u2019s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholzlost a confidence vote. \\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\\u201d Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attackat a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD. In September, Musk praised Italy\\u2019s far-rightPrime Minister Giorgia Meloniduring a black-tie event in New York, calling her a \\u201cprecious genius\\u201d and \\u201ceven more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.\\u201d Meanwhile, behind the scenes,\\u00a0he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Musk met directly with Xi at a 2023 dinner in San Francisco. His Tesla electric vehicles are largely\\u00a0manufactured in China, including at its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\\u2019s largest factories. Asked about Musk\\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \\u201cI\\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\\u2019s Trump.\\u201d And in the U.S., Musk has already shown signs of his power over the political process, pushing the country\\u2019s government to the brink of a shutdown after joining with Trump toeffectively killa congressionalspending bill. While Musk\\u2019s outsize role showed what he can achieve in Washington, his capacity to wield political influence may begin to stretch beyond U.S. borders.

But they\\u2019re also signs of its rapid growth since the election. As Bluesky attracts more activity, particularly from thosefleeing Elon Musk\\u2019s X, it is facing the price of success: tough moderation decisions and a growing number of bad actors. Nearly 25 million people have signed up for the platform,according tometrics site ClearSky. While that number is still a fraction of X\\u2019s user base, Bluesky\\u2019s controversies and challenges are gaining mainstream attention \\u2014 a sign of its increasing cultural relevance. Last week, the platform faced its most significant controversy yet: user backlash against journalist and media personality Jesse Singal joining the platform. Singal, who has reported on people who reversed their gender transitions among other topics pertaining to trans people, hosts a podcast that critiques perceived left-wing biases in media. LGBTQ nonprofitGLAADincluded Singal in its Accountability Project documenting \\u201canti-LGBTQ rhetoric and discriminatory actions\\u201d by public figures. Singal\\u2019s presence on Bluesky, considered a hub for trans social media users, sparked apetitionsigned by over 25,000 people calling for his removal under the platform\\u2019s moderation policies. Singal is now the most blocked person on Bluesky. Bluesky didn\\u2019t address Singal explicitly in its response to the petition, butpostedthat it does not take down accounts based on activity off the platform. Bluesky didn\\u2019t respond to an NBC News question about the controversy around Singal, whohas reportedreceiving death threats he says the platform has not adequately addressed. Despite the uproar spilling onto other social media platforms like X and attracting attention from mainstreamfigures like Lizzo, most Bluesky users appear to be sticking with the platform. Beyond cultural flash points, Bluesky is also grappling with a range of brass-tacks moderation issues that come as the price of popularity. In one 24-hour period this November, the company announced it had received a record 42,000 moderation reports. \\u201cWe appreciate your patience as we dial our moderation team up to max capacity and bring on new team members to support this load,\\u201dBluesky said. After Brazil\\u2019s top court suspended access to X in August, Bluesky saw a surge in Brazilian users, including\\u201cstan\\u201d communitiesdevoted to particular artists. That led to an influx of copyright complaints, leaving Bluesky\\u2019s slim moderation team to sift through which posts to keep and remove, said Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky\\u2019s head of trust and safety, in an interview. \\u201cBrazilians love doing memes. They\\u2019re a fantastic user base. But our copyright requests went through the roof,\\u201d said Rodericks, who previously helped lead Twitter\\u2019s trust and safety team. Scammers have also followed the migration of social media users from X to Bluesky, Sean Gallagher, a principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos, told NBC News.\\u00a0 \\u201cOver the past few weeks, there has been a rapid increase in scam activity,\\u201d he said. Many are romance and \\u201cpig butchering\\u201d scammers who follow the same playbook they use on other social media sites: posing as romantic prospects in the hopes of establishing a fake relationship with a victim they can later exploit for money, Gallagher said. So far, Bluesky \\u201chas been aggressive in shutting down fraudulent accounts,\\u201d Gallagher said, and appears to respond well to people reporting suspicious accounts. Rodericks said even as Bluesky has experienced growing pains, they\\u2019re still not at the large scale seen on other major social media platforms. \\u201cThere\\u2019s things that come with hundreds of millions of users, in terms of harms, that we\\u2019re not seeing yet.\\u201d But that hasn\\u2019t stopped some critics from zeroing in on the issues. Far-right X account Libs of TikTok, which is known for targeting trans people online, criticized Bluesky on Thursday, posting screenshots of articles written about the platform \\u2014 one written by Singal about the death threats he said he received, and another about child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the platform. Bluesky has seen only a handful of instances of people posting CSAM, Rodericks said, when compared to the levels seen on other platforms, but the numbers are increasing. In 2023, while the site could only be accessed through invitation and before it had opened to the public, there was only one verified complaint to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the U.S. organization tasked with tracking online exploitation. This year, Rodericks said, there have been over 830 CSAM cases, each of which the company investigates manually. Most major social media platforms report much higher rates of CSAM. In 2023, X reported 273,416 instances of CSAM on its platforms, according to the center. Instagram reported 11,430,007. Posting CSAM prompts an immediate and full ban on the site, Rodericks said. The site also has its share of fake celebrity accounts, a problem that continues to plague larger platforms too. Last month, Bluesky began labeling fake celebrity accounts with \\u201cimpersonation\\u201d if they didn\\u2019t label themselves as satire or fan accounts, ending the reign of a handful of accounts that registered famous people\\u2019s usernames soon after the platform launched. While it doesn\\u2019t appear that there is a vast ecosystem of celebrity impersonators aimed at scamming users, NBC News easily found a handful of unlabeled but clearly fake accounts for celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey and Cristiano Ronaldo. Representatives for those three didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Bluesky\\u2019s approach to verifying that accounts are who they say they are \\u2014 a problem that hasplagued Xin particular since Musk\\u2019s changes last year \\u2014 is both unique and more technically difficult than other sites\\u2019. It treats every account as a website and lets anyone who owns a web domain register a Bluesky account with that URL. So instead of Bluesky verifying people\\u2019s identity individually, it lets anyone with an official website verify themselves and other users. \\u201cWe are getting feedback that some people are finding it too technically challenging, because people are just used to usernames. So the question is whether through enough user education, etc., we can meet those needs through domain verification, or if we have to add other aspects in addition to that,\\u201d Rodericks said. Given Bluesky\\u2019s limited resources, Rodericks said, it doesn\\u2019t have immediate plans to label state-controlled news agencies from authoritarian governments, as Meta does and X did before Musk ended that practice. There are at least three Bluesky accounts that use the names of and only post stories from state-controlled news agencies \\u2014\\u00a0China Daily and People\\u2019s Daily from China, and RT from Russia \\u2014 but none has more than a few hundred followers. None of the three news agencies responded to emails asking if those accounts were authentic. Disinformation researchers routinely identify account swarms, particularly pushing messages sympathetic to the Russian, Chinese and Iranian governments, on major social media platforms, although they rarely get significant traction. Often, those investigations start when the FBI alerts a social media platform to U.S. intelligence that it\\u2019s being exploited by an adversary to the U.S. To date, the FBI has not made that kind of outreach to Bluesky, Rodericks said. It also doesn\\u2019t have a dedicated internal team to hunt that kind of propaganda, but instead relies on user tips, automated sensors for inauthentic account behavior, and a volunteer moderator army managed through a nonprofit calledIndependent Federated Trust & Safetyto identify and take down activity that violates its terms of service. While there have not been clearly documented mass propaganda campaigns on Bluesky so far, researchers have seen some signs. \\u201cAll social media platforms are used by adversaries,\\u201d Lisa Kaplan, the CEO of Alethea, a company that tracks coordinated online messaging and propaganda campaigns, told NBC News. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve seen evidence of what is likely state actor activity on the platform. That said, it\\u2019s early and we\\u2019ve not yet seen a successful, coordinated effort.\\u201d \\u201cIn general, we\\u2019re still very small fries, so people aren\\u2019t dedicating resources towards us from a nation-state kind of front,\\u201d Rodericks said. Bluesky has been blocked by at least two censorship-prone governments. According to the Great Firewall, a program that tracks internet censorship in China, the countrybegan blockingBluesky ahead of June 4, the anniversary of theTiananmen Squareprotests, a common spur for censorship in the country. Separately, Pakistanbriefly blockedBluesky in November, according to NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet blocking. Spokespeople for both countries\\u2019 consulates didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Every social media platform has to walk the line between obeying the laws of every country it wants to operate in and deciding to resist potentially unfair government requests to block posts or turn over user information. But China and Pakistan didn\\u2019t prompt a debate, Rodericks said. \\u201cNeither government has done any type of outreach or communication to Bluesky,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFrom a principles perspective, we of course believe in a free and open internet, so we\\u2019re going to do our best to support the ability of citizens to access the community\\u2019s information. But as a small player in this space, we\\u2019ll do what we can to advance our objective balance against countries being able to control their own internet.\\u201d Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News.\",\n          \"Lara Trump, President-electDonald Trump's daughter-in-law, said on Saturday that she decided to remove her name from consideration to be a senator in Florida.

Even while at the RNC, Lara Trump had previously expressed openness to working in another position, fueling speculation that the Senate slot could become hers. \\\"If I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor.

Scammers have also followed the migration of social media users from X to Bluesky, Sean Gallagher, a principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos, told NBC News. \\u201cOver the past few weeks, there has been a rapid increase in scam activity,\\u201d he said. Many are romance and \\u201cpig butchering\\u201d scammers who follow the same playbook they use on\",\n          \"Lara Trump, President-electDonald Trump's daughter-in-law, said on Saturday that she decided to remove her name from consideration to be a senator in Florida. The announcementquashed speculationthat she was interested in replacing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump wants to serve as secretary of state. \\\"After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,\\\" Lara Trump said ina post to X. She went on to tease a \\\"big announcement\\\" that she would share in January. \\\"I remain incredibly passionate about public service and look forward to serving our country again sometime in the future,\\\" she added. \\\"In the meantime, I wish Governor DeSantis the best of luck with this appointment.\\\" Earlier this month,she announcedthat she would step down as co-chair of the Republican National Convention. She previously ascended to the role in March. Trump, who ismarriedto the president-elect\\u2019s son Eric, reiterated in her post that she \\\"could not have been more honored to serve as RNC co-chair,\\\" adding that she was \\\"truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida.\\\" If Rubio is confirmed by the Senate to serve as secretary of state, his seat will become vacant. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis haspreviously saidthat his team would likely make a selection for who fills Rubio's seat by the beginning of January. \\\"Florida deserves a Senator who will help President Trump deliver on his election mandate, be strong on immigration and border security, take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state, reverse the nation\\u2019s fiscal decline, be animated by conservative principles, and has a proven record of results,\\\" DeSantis said in a November post to X after Trump tapped Rubio. Even while at the RNC, Lara Trump had previously expressed openness to working in another position, fueling speculation that the Senate slot could become hers. \\\"If I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor. I have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me,\\\" she toldFox Newsin November.

What began as a tech mogul railingagainst political correctnessin the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments onboth sides of the Atlanticto reckon with Musk\\u2019s growing political and cultural influence. Last week, Farage told the BBC that his Reform UK party was in \\u201congoing negotiations\\u201d with Musk after the pair met at Donald Trump\\u2019sMar-a-Lago estate. Musk, a South Africa-born U.S. citizen, is prohibited from making a personal donation to a British political party, but he could potentially contribute through the U.K. subsidiaries of his various companies, which reportedly made around \\u00a390 million in profits over the past two years. \\u201cHe wants to help us. He\\u2019s not opposed to the idea of giving us money, provided we can do it legally through U.K. companies,\\u201d Farage said. The U.K.\\u2019s Electoral Commission has said Prime Minister Keir Starmer must strengthen rules around political donations to protect its elections from foreign interference,according to the U.K.\\u2019s Guardian newspaper. Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies. While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire\\u2019s words carry weight well beyond the tech world. Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called \\u201cwoke mind virus\\u201d and championing anti-immigration rhetoric. His transformation aligns with the resurgence ofPresident-elect Donald Trumpand the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France\\u2019s National Rally,led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politicianGeert Wilders. His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire\\u2019s politics. Musk\\u2019s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a \\u201ctyrannical police state,\\u201d amplified calls for a general electionjust months after Starmer became prime minister,and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist. Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe,Musklast weekopenly endorsedGermany\\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country\\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. The AfD\\u2019s leader, Bj\\u00f6rn H\\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefullyemploying Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings. Musk\\u2019s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany\\u2019s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholzlost a confidence vote. \\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\\u201d Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attackat a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD. In September, Musk praised Italy\\u2019s far-rightPrime Minister Giorgia Meloniduring a\",\n          \"Government censorship, scam accounts, celebrity impersonation, propaganda and a user revolt over a journalist accused of demonizing trans people \\u2014 these are just some of the hurdles faced by the nascent social media platform Bluesky. But they\\u2019re also signs of its rapid growth since the election. As Bluesky attracts more activity, particularly from thosefleeing Elon Musk\\u2019s X, it is facing the price of success: tough moderation decisions and a growing number of bad actors. Nearly 25 million people have signed up for the platform,according tometrics site ClearSky. While that number is still a fraction of X\\u2019s user base, Bluesky\\u2019s controversies and challenges are gaining mainstream attention \\u2014 a sign of its increasing cultural relevance. Last week, the platform faced its most significant controversy yet: user backlash against journalist and media personality Jesse Singal joining the platform. Singal, who has reported on people who reversed their gender transitions among other topics pertaining to trans people, hosts a podcast that critiques perceived left-wing biases in media. LGBTQ nonprofitGLAADincluded Singal in its Accountability Project documenting \\u201canti-LGBTQ rhetoric and discriminatory actions\\u201d by public figures. Singal\\u2019s presence on Bluesky, considered a hub for trans social media users, sparked apetitionsigned by over 25,000 people calling for his removal under the platform\\u2019s moderation policies. Singal is now the most blocked person on Bluesky. Bluesky didn\\u2019t address Singal explicitly in its response to the petition, butpostedthat it does not take down accounts based on activity off the platform. Bluesky didn\\u2019t respond to an NBC News question about the controversy around Singal, whohas reportedreceiving death threats he says the platform has not adequately addressed. Despite the uproar spilling onto other social media platforms like X and attracting attention from mainstreamfigures like Lizzo, most Bluesky users appear to be sticking with the platform. Beyond cultural flash points, Bluesky is also grappling with a range of brass-tacks moderation issues that come as the price of popularity. In one 24-hour period this November, the company announced it had received a record 42,000 moderation reports. \\u201cWe appreciate your patience as we dial our moderation team up to max capacity and bring on new team members to support this load,\\u201dBluesky said. After Brazil\\u2019s top court suspended access to X in August, Bluesky saw a surge in Brazilian users, including\\u201cstan\\u201d communitiesdevoted to particular artists. That led to an influx of copyright complaints, leaving Bluesky\\u2019s slim moderation team to sift through which posts to keep and remove, said Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky\\u2019s head of trust and safety, in an interview. \\u201cBrazilians love doing memes. They\\u2019re a fantastic user base. But our copyright requests went through the roof,\\u201d said Rodericks, who previously helped lead Twitter\\u2019s trust and safety team. Scammers have also followed the migration of social media users from X to Bluesky, Sean Gallagher, a principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos, told NBC News. \\u201cOver the past few weeks, there has been a rapid increase in scam activity,\\u201d he said. Many are romance and \\u201cpig butchering\\u201d scammers who follow the same playbook they use on\",\n          \"Lara Trump, President-electDonald Trump's daughter-in-law, said on Saturday that she decided to remove her name from consideration to be a senator in Florida. The announcementquashed speculationthat she was interested in replacing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump wants to serve as secretary of state. \\\"After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,\\\" Lara Trump said ina post to X. She went on to tease a \\\"big announcement\\\" that she would share in January. \\\"I remain incredibly passionate about public service and look forward to serving our country again sometime in the future,\\\" she added. \\\"In the meantime, I wish Governor DeSantis the best of luck with this appointment.\\\" Earlier this month,she announcedthat she would step down as co-chair of the Republican National Convention. She previously ascended to the role in March. Trump, who ismarriedto the president-elect\\u2019s son Eric, reiterated in her post that she \\\"could not have been more honored to serve as RNC co-chair,\\\" adding that she was \\\"truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida.\\\" If Rubio is confirmed by the Senate to serve as secretary of state, his seat will become vacant. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis haspreviously saidthat his team would likely make a selection for who fills Rubio's seat by the beginning of January. \\\"Florida deserves a Senator who will help President Trump deliver on his election mandate, be strong on immigration and border security, take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state, reverse the nation\\u2019s fiscal decline, be animated by conservative principles, and has a proven record of results,\\\" DeSantis said in a November post to X after Trump tapped Rubio. Even while at the RNC, Lara Trump had previously expressed openness to working in another position, fueling speculation that the Senate slot could become hers. \\\"If I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor. I have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me,\\\" she toldFox Newsin November.

              "['When President-elect Donald Trump retakes the White House in January, he could be flanked by a large cohort of young Indian American stars. There’s Kash Patel, who could become Trump’s FBI director if he’s confirmed, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who with Elon Musk will lead a new nongovernmental project called the Department of Government Efficiency. Alongside them, with quieter public receptions, Harmeet Dhillon and Jay Bhattacharya prepare for potential key roles in the Department of Justice and the National Institutes of Health, respectively. And there’s Vice President-elect JD Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, who will be the first South Asian American second lady. These Indian Americans are perhaps the most well-represented minority group on the president-elect’s newly announced team. With this ethnic group making up less than 2% of the population and typically among themost Democraticof all Asian subgroups, many find it surprising. Others say the Indian American community has been poised to fit into the current Republican mold for some time. As Trump cozies up to tech industry titans, continues to lambast China and cheers on India’s current government, it doesn’t appear to be an accident that Indian Americans are taking on key roles in his administration, experts said. “It’s remarkable how disproportionately represented Indian Americans are compared to other communities of color,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data. Their embrace of some of Trump’s positions — like Patel’s baselessaccusationsabout a secret “deep state” and Ramaswamy’s calls for massdeportations— are out of sync with the politics of most Indian Americans, experts said. But that might be changing. NBC News polling did not disaggregate for ethnicity, but according to national surveys of the Asian American electorate by AAPI Data, support for Democratic candidates has dipped. After the2016 election, 77% of Indian Americans said they voted for Hillary Clinton. In September 2024, 69% said they planned to vote for Harris. Asian Americans more broadlyshiftedright by 5 points, compared to 3.2 points for thegeneral population. “Trump had higher support among 18- to 34-year-old Indian Americans, and especially among Indian American men,” Ramakrishnan said. “It’s not just the native-born younger men like Ramaswamy and Kash Patel. It includes foreign-born younger men who are likely recently naturalized. You probably have a fair number of people working in tech.” Some find this mutual affinity contradictory to the story that brought them to the U.S. Trump campaigned on a heavily anti-immigrant platform, with allies like Ramaswamy promising to slash the H-1B visa program and even revoke birthright citizenship. In a statement to NBC News, the Trump team said Biden’s “incompetence” and undocumented immigration brought Indian Americans into the party. “Fed up with the last four years of economic stagnation, unlimited illegal immigration, and general incompetence under the Biden administration, Indian Americans came out in historic numbers to give President Donald J. Trump and his agenda to Make America Great Again a resounding mandate,” said Kush Desai, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson. Neither Ramaswamy nor Patel responded to requests for comment. “I think it fits really well with Trump’s',\n",
              " 'LONDON — Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are wrestling with a decision to fast-track legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in national elections afterfar-right leader Nigel Faragesuggested thatElon Muskcould donate to his once-fringe right-wing party, in the latest turn for the world’s richest man as he flexes his newfound political muscle. What began as a tech mogul railingagainst political correctnessin the U.S. has evolved into what appears to be a global campaign of support for far-right ideologies, forcing governments onboth sides of the Atlanticto reckon with Musk’s growing political and cultural influence. Last week, Farage told the BBC that his Reform UK party was in “ongoing negotiations” with Musk after the pair met at Donald Trump’sMar-a-Lago estate. Musk, a South Africa-born U.S. citizen, is prohibited from making a personal donation to a British political party, but he could potentially contribute through the U.K. subsidiaries of his various companies, which reportedly made around £90 million in profits over the past two years. “He wants to help us. He’s not opposed to the idea of giving us money, provided we can do it legally through U.K. companies,” Farage said. The U.K.’s Electoral Commission has said Prime Minister Keir Starmer must strengthen rules around political donations to protect its elections from foreign interference,according to the U.K.’s Guardian newspaper. Such reforms could limit the amount a foreign national can donate via U.K.-based companies. While some U.K. lawmakers are reportedly resisting the demands, a discussion between Farage and Musk in Florida has sent lawmakers scrambling over 4,000 miles away, showing once again how the billionaire’s words carry weight well beyond the tech world. Once a self-proclaimed centrist who donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Musk has increasingly embraced far-right ideologies, frequently decrying the so-called “woke mind virus” and championing anti-immigration rhetoric. His transformation aligns with the resurgence ofPresident-elect Donald Trumpand the rise of far-right parties across Europe, including France’s National Rally,led by Marine Le Pen, and the Dutch anti-Islam politicianGeert Wilders. His encounter with Farage is not the first time the U.K. has had to reckon with the billionaire’s politics. Musk’s clashes with the center-left Starmer have been both public and inflammatory. Musk has accused Britain of being a “tyrannical police state,” amplified calls for a general electionjust months after Starmer became prime minister,and shared a video by a jailed far-right activist. Across the English Channel, in mainland Europe,Musklast weekopenly endorsedGermany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party under surveillance by the country’s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. The AfD’s leader, Björn Höcke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefullyemploying Nazi rhetoric, though he has appealed the rulings. Musk’s backing of the AfD coincides with Germany’s upcoming snap elections, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholzlost a confidence vote. “Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk said on X, the morning before a deadly attackat a Christmas market in Magdeburg, where the suspect was revealed to sympathize with far-right movements, including the AfD. In September, Musk praised Italy’s far-rightPrime Minister Giorgia Meloniduring a',\n",
              " 'Lara Trump, President-electDonald Trump\\'s daughter-in-law, said on Saturday that she decided to remove her name from consideration to be a senator in Florida. The announcementquashed speculationthat she was interested in replacing Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump wants to serve as secretary of state. \"After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,\" Lara Trump said ina post to X. She went on to tease a \"big announcement\" that she would share in January. \"I remain incredibly passionate about public service and look forward to serving our country again sometime in the future,\" she added. \"In the meantime, I wish Governor DeSantis the best of luck with this appointment.\" Earlier this month,she announcedthat she would step down as co-chair of the Republican National Convention. She previously ascended to the role in March. Trump, who ismarriedto the president-elect’s son Eric, reiterated in her post that she \"could not have been more honored to serve as RNC co-chair,\" adding that she was \"truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida.\" If Rubio is confirmed by the Senate to serve as secretary of state, his seat will become vacant. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis haspreviously saidthat his team would likely make a selection for who fills Rubio\\'s seat by the beginning of January. \"Florida deserves a Senator who will help President Trump deliver on his election mandate, be strong on immigration and border security, take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state, reverse the nation’s fiscal decline, be animated by conservative principles, and has a proven record of results,\" DeSantis said in a November post to X after Trump tapped Rubio. Even while at the RNC, Lara Trump had previously expressed openness to working in another position, fueling speculation that the Senate slot could become hers. \"If I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor. I have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me,\" she toldFox Newsin November. Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.',\n",
              " 'Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctoraccused of killing four women and a nine-year-old boy bydriving into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, now faces charges of five counts of murder, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault after appearing in court Saturday night. His court appearance comes as details emerge about the attack and his possible motivations. Germanprivacy laws prevent authorities from releasing the suspect\\'s full name, though they confirmed that his first name was Taleb. Two senior U.S. officials familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News that al-Abdulmohsen was the suspect. The incident occurred on Friday when a black BMWplowed through the crowded market, leaving 200 people injured, about 40 of them in a critical condition. The victims are a 9-year-old boy and four women, aged 52, 45, 67 and 75. Al-Abdulmohsen bypassed security bollards—set up to prevent such attacks—with the rental vehicle and entered the crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg through a gap meant for emergency vehicles, Tom-Oliver Langhans, director of the Magdeburg police, said at a press conference Saturday. Once inside, al-Abdulmohsen drove 1,200 feet at speed into the narrow, crowded alley, knocking scores of people to the ground. Forensic scientists are probing whether he had intentionally disabled the car’s emergency braking system to maximize impact. Minutes after the attack, armed police confronted al-Abdulmohsen near the wrecked vehicle in a dramatic arrest witnessed by shocked bystanders. Magdeburg Police said investigations are ongoing and officers are appealing for witnesses to send in photos or video of the incident. At the press conference Saturday evening, officials revealed that al-Abdulmohsen had been questioned, without revealing what he had said. Nopens said the motive is still being investigated but that “the background of the act” could be linked to “dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany.” Officials said Friday that al-Abdulmohsen acted alone, which former New York State Homeland Security Advisor Michael Balboni characterized as the \"worst case scenario for security officials.\" “This came out of nowhere,\" he told MSNBC\\'s Alex Witt. \"You can monitor social media, but for the most part you’re not going to know the timing on this or what they’re going to do.” Al-Abdulmohsen had voiced anger at German police and at Germany, allegedly previously saying that, “The nation that is actively criminally chasing Islam critics to ruin their lives is the German nation.” He had first first entered Germany in 2006, sought asylum there in 2016, citing threats from Saudi Arabia, and worked at a clinic as a “specialist in psychiatry.” The clinic, in the city of Bernberg, 25 miles south of the attack, confirmed his employment to NBC News, saying that he had not been on duty since October, due to \"vacation and illness.\" His online activity includes historic and recent inflammatory content on X, and he has been accused of erratic behavior by an NGO for refugees. He has aligned himself with far-right movements such as Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. When asked whether the attacker',\n",
              " 'Government censorship, scam accounts, celebrity impersonation, propaganda and a user revolt over a journalist accused of demonizing trans people — these are just some of the hurdles faced by the nascent social media platform Bluesky. But they’re also signs of its rapid growth since the election. As Bluesky attracts more activity, particularly from thosefleeing Elon Musk’s X, it is facing the price of success: tough moderation decisions and a growing number of bad actors. Nearly 25 million people have signed up for the platform,according tometrics site ClearSky. While that number is still a fraction of X’s user base, Bluesky’s controversies and challenges are gaining mainstream attention — a sign of its increasing cultural relevance. Last week, the platform faced its most significant controversy yet: user backlash against journalist and media personality Jesse Singal joining the platform. Singal, who has reported on people who reversed their gender transitions among other topics pertaining to trans people, hosts a podcast that critiques perceived left-wing biases in media. LGBTQ nonprofitGLAADincluded Singal in its Accountability Project documenting “anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and discriminatory actions” by public figures. Singal’s presence on Bluesky, considered a hub for trans social media users, sparked apetitionsigned by over 25,000 people calling for his removal under the platform’s moderation policies. Singal is now the most blocked person on Bluesky. Bluesky didn’t address Singal explicitly in its response to the petition, butpostedthat it does not take down accounts based on activity off the platform. Bluesky didn’t respond to an NBC News question about the controversy around Singal, whohas reportedreceiving death threats he says the platform has not adequately addressed. Despite the uproar spilling onto other social media platforms like X and attracting attention from mainstreamfigures like Lizzo, most Bluesky users appear to be sticking with the platform. Beyond cultural flash points, Bluesky is also grappling with a range of brass-tacks moderation issues that come as the price of popularity. In one 24-hour period this November, the company announced it had received a record 42,000 moderation reports. “We appreciate your patience as we dial our moderation team up to max capacity and bring on new team members to support this load,”Bluesky said. After Brazil’s top court suspended access to X in August, Bluesky saw a surge in Brazilian users, including“stan” communitiesdevoted to particular artists. That led to an influx of copyright complaints, leaving Bluesky’s slim moderation team to sift through which posts to keep and remove, said Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky’s head of trust and safety, in an interview. “Brazilians love doing memes. They’re a fantastic user base. But our copyright requests went through the roof,” said Rodericks, who previously helped lead Twitter’s trust and safety team. Scammers have also followed the migration of social media users from X to Bluesky, Sean Gallagher, a principal threat researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos, told NBC News. “Over the past few weeks, there has been a rapid increase in scam activity,” he said. Many are romance and “pig butchering” scammers who follow the same playbook they use on']"
